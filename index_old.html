        <p class="siteinfo">The core of Radical Scatters consists of eighty-two documents carrying over one hundred
          fragmentary texts composed by Dickinson in the final decades of her life. In addition to
          the core texts, the archive’s primary materials include fifty-three poems, letters, and
          other writings by Dickinson with direct links to the fragments. While the manuscripts of
          the fragments are housed at the Amherst College Library, the manuscripts of the related
          texts are divided among seven libraries—Amherst College Library (29), Houghton Library
          (12), Boston Public Library (6), New York Public Library (1), Yale University Library (1),
          Princeton University Library (1), The Rosenbach Museum and Library (1), the Jones Library,
          Inc. (1)—and one private collection (Oresman, 1).<br/><br/> The criteria for inclusion
          used in this version of Radical Scatters are as follows: all of the fragments featured as
          “core” texts have been assigned composition dates of 1870 or after; all of the core
          fragments are materially discrete; and all of the core fragments are inherently
          autonomous, whether or not they also appear as traces in other texts. Of the approximately
          one hundred extant fragments I took as my point of departure, almost half descend to us as
          independent passages, as brief texts that either have no direct links to other poems or
          letters in Dickinson’s oeuvre or whose links to these texts is now irretrievable. Like
          Emerson’s souls, neither touching nor mingling, never composing a set, these positionless
          fragments depict the beauties of transition and isolation at once. Belonging to a
          chronology of the instant, vulnerability is the mark of their existence: they belong, if
          at all, to a discontinuous series, or to a “book from which each page could be taken out”
          (Cixous 105). <br/><br/> The remaining fragments are “trace fragments,” or
          fragments—sometimes avant-textes, sometimes inter-texts, sometimes post-texts—associated
          with a larger constellation of poems, letters, or drafts among Dickinson’s papers. Again
          and again, as if poems, letters, and fragments communicated telepathically, a line or
          phrase from a fragment re-appears, often altered, in the body of a poem, a message, or
          even another fragment. Yet the painstaking effort to identify all such trace fragments and
          link them with the texts in which they appear fails to effect any lasting closure: neither
          residents nor aliens, neither lost nor found, these trace fragments are caught between
          their attraction to specific, bounded texts and their resistance to incorporation.
          Instead, they require that we attend to the mystery of the encounters between fragments,
          poems, and letters, listening especially to the ways in which, like leitmotifs, the
          fragments both influence the modalities of the compositions in which they momentarily take
          asylum and carry those leitmotifs beyond the finished compositions into another space and
          time.<br/><br/> The inclusion of fragments belonging to a constellation of texts—i.e.,
          trial beginnings, re-workings or repairs of textual situations, etc. of a given poem or
          letter—is especially vexed. In instances where there are several possible “fragments” in a
          given constellation, I have in general selected the briefest and most difficult to
          classify text as the “core” document, while also attempting to specify its relationships
          to other associated texts. Thus although it has been my intention to include all of the
          late fragments possessing aesthetic or formal integrity, the term “fragment” is itself a
          problematic one, and the list of contents must be understood as provisional rather than
          definitive. The fragments in Radical Scatters offer only an entry point into the mass of
          late, unbound, extra-territorial writings in Dickinson’s oeuvre. In the future, some of
          the documents included in the present archive will fall outside of it, while others, not
          yet identified as fragments, will enter it, producing not new “collections” but, rather,
          unforeseen and anomalous orders. </p>
