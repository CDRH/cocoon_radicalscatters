            <epigraph>
               <p>Navigation is first of all a labor of displacement.  &#8212;Michel de Certeau</p>
            </epigraph>
            <p>While the non-hierarchical or decentered structure of the archive reflects the fragments' irreducible singularity and insusceptibility to collection in a "book," the archive's system of nonlinear links reveals, on the other hand, their openness to and participation in multiple textual constellations and/or contingent orders.</p>
            <p>In his recent book <title>Open Sky,</title> Paul Virilio calls our attention to the concept of trajectivity: "It seems we are still incapable of seriously entertaining this  <hi rend="italics">question of the path,</hi> except in the realms of mechanics, ballistics or astronomy. Objectivity, subjectivity, certainly, but never  <hi rend="italics">trajectivity."</hi>
               <note n="56">Paul Virilio, <title>Open Sky,</title> translated by Julie Rose (London: Verso, 1997), 24.</note> The hypertext archive offers a new site for an exploration of trajectivity. At times, the close study of elements and attributes within a given document will delimit the trajectory of an exploration. At other times, the exploration of document constellations and especially the relations among the fragments and the texts in which they reappear creates a dialectic process leading the reader toward the discovery of new patterns. And, at still other times, a reader may act as a "shifter," cutting his or her way across the various levels of the archive by following a single code or a combination of codes (that is, documents with canceled faces; documents written in ink; documents written on envelope fragments, etc.). In the archive, theories of navigation are subject to change during the course of a research session as a result of unforeseen discoveries or new questions. The number of codes, types, searchable fields, and links is finite and editorially determined; the number of paths that can be traced through the materials, however, is almost limitless&#8212;or, rather, limited only by the reader's willingness to track individual codes, attributes, and elements and to collate search results, or by his or her imagination of virtual itineraries. In general, the best readers of Dickinson's fragments do not read linearly, but recursively, finding, often by losing, their different ways through the materials of the archive. The paths traced by the reader through the electronic archive are the "traveler's tales" that Virilio fears will be lost, along with "the possibility of some kind of interpretation," on the information superhighway.<note n="57">Paul Virilio, <title>Open Sky,</title> 25.</note> To be sure, there are risks. As Mireille Rosello writes, since the "screener's navigation. . . .[is] both read and written at the same time. . .meaning. . . [becomes] fragile, easily destroyed, [almost] impossible to record."<note n="55a">See Mireille Rosello, "The Screener's Maps: Michel de Certeau's 'WandersmÃ¤nner' and Paul Auster's Hypertextual Detective," in <title>Hyper/Text /Theory,</title> edited by George P. Landow (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994), 121&#8211;58.</note> Yet however fragile, illegible, or quickly erased these virtual itineraries (the inscription of which begins the moment the reader enters the archive, and ends only arbitrarily when he or she exits) may be, they are also new signifying (critical, creative) narratives that we cannot ignore and that require a new theory&#8212;a new method&#8212;of (speed) <hi rend="italics">readingwriting</hi> (screening).</p>
            <p>The power of the archive is above all the power to induce a departure: "And I wonder if it may not be desirable at this point to experiment widely with disorientation rather than safety."<note n="55">See Mireille Rosello, "The Screener's Maps: Michel de Certeau's 'WandersmÃ¤nner' and Paul Auster's Hypertextual Detective," in <title>Hyper/Text /Theory,</title> edited by George P. Landow (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994), 121&#8211;58.</note>

            <head type="general section heading">Search: Document Features</head>
            <p>The decision to transcribe all of the texts on a given document runs counter to the conventional editorial treatment of Dickinson's late fragments. In Thomas H. Johnson's <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), for example, apparently discrete text fragments inscribed across a single document are removed from their material context, divided between two editorially determined categories ("To Unidentified Recipients," "Aphorisms"), and then printed alphabetically by first line in a numbered series that no longer reflects their relationship either to the document on which they were inscribed or to one another. Respecting the integrity of the physical document and carefully mapping its zones (folds, seams, etc.) makes possible analyses of the relations between and among the texts each document carries. Moreover, since the document is often a metaphorical as well as an actual container for thoughts&#8212;an envelope shaped like a bird carries a text about flight; an envelope seal becomes the space for a meditation on secrecy; the two sides of a document are inscribed with rhyming texts; a torn edge corresponds to a textual verge, etc.&#8212;maintaining the integrity of the physical document facilitates further investigation into the relationship between Dickinson's medium and her messages.</p>
            <p>The "Index of Documents Carrying Fragments" lists the core documents in the archive by catalog number and offers thumbnail images of the first page of each document.</p>

            <head type="subhead">Text Types</head>
            <p>The analysis of Dickinson's late manuscripts brings to light a considerable number of text types: in addition to poems and letters there are fragments, notes and ideas toward poems, working notes and phrases, trial lines, and variant lines.  The need to account for all of the possible texts that emerge during the transcription of a given document has been accommodated by the use of the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> element. Each <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> identifies an apparently discrete text, which is in turn assigned a "type." The "typing" of Dickinson's late texts is a matter of interpretation (and debate); the types listed below should be treated as a "working list," rather than an exhaustive or definitive list. Many of the fragments are too brief to be classified definitively as "prose" or "verse," while others continually shift between prose and verse. Moreover, the assumption frequently made by textual editors that text types can be determined retrospectively&#8212;a text fragment that is incorporated into a poem is a "verse fragment," while a text fragment incorporated into a letter is a "prose fragment"&#8212;is also not tenable, first because it fails to account for the essential autonomy of the fragment and its resistance to classification, and second because it fails to recognize that the author's intentions toward a fragment may be multiple. Here fragments are typed as "extrageneric" except in instances where a fragment is clearly a message to a specific (and usually identifiable) addressee and cannot also be considered a freestanding, autonomous text. Notes regarding type, state (rough-copy draft, intermediate-copy draft, fair-copy draft, etc.), media (pencil, ink), and hand (rough, intermediate, fair) are provided at the level of the text <hi rend="small caps">(DIV1),</hi> rather than at the level of the document<hi rend="small caps">(DIV0).</hi> Text-specific notes about type, state, media, and hand are especially important given Dickinson's practice of inscribing multiple texts in different states, media, and hands on a single document.</p>
            <p>Information concerning the original location of the documents is provided at the level of the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1.</hi> Manuscripts sent by Dickinson outside of her personal archive are marked "mailed"; unmarked manuscripts may be assumed to have remained among Dickinson's own papers. Similarly, manuscripts bound into volumes are marked "bound"; unmarked manuscripts may be assumed to be loose sheets or fragments.</p>
            <p>The determinations of "state" made here are open to revision. The terms "rough-copy," "intermediate-copy," and "fair-copy" are not ideal terms with which to describe documents of an essentially private nature. In order to distinguish a fair-copy sent out of Dickinson's personal archive from a fair-copy housed within her personal archive I have added the word "draft" to the latter category. The vast majority of the fragments appear to be rough-copy drafts. In only a few special cases&#8212;when a fragment appears to have progressed from a rough-copy to an intermediate-copy draft, or when a fragment has been excerpted from a fair-copy draft, for instance&#8212;have I offered a more refined hypothesis about the state of the fragment at the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> level. </p>

            <head type="subhead">Internal Textual Divisions</head>
            <p>The textual field is continuously divisible into smaller and smaller parts, greater and greater detail. The need to account for all of the possible internal divisions has been accommodated by the use of the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element. In verse texts, the stanza or verse line has generally been understood to be the base structural unit. Dickinson's writings, however, challenge the ways in which we understand and mark internal textual divisions. Her commitment to metrical experimentation, particularly her breaking (out) of traditional meters, often leads to considerable uncertainty about what constitutes a line of verse. The noncorrespondence in her poems, moreover, between "metrically complete" lines and physical line breaks, many of which appear to be intentional, further problematizes the choice of the base structural unit. Rather than dividing verse texts into verse lines, I have divided them into stanzas; in verse texts without clear stanza divisions, the text remains undivided and the notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element reads simply: "lines, verse." The <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element has also been used to mark "variant clusters," the strings of variant or additional word choices often appearing below the body proper of the poem.</p>
            <p>In prose texts the paragraph or, in certain instances, the sentence, has generally been understood as the base structural unit. Here, too, however, this base structural unit is problematic. In the first place, Dickinson did not use paragraphs in a conventional way: in her rough-copy prose texts there is rarely any division of lines into paragraphs; in her fair-copy prose texts there is often evidence of division, but the divisions are not always clear both because Dickinson did not in general indent the opening line of a "paragraph" and also because while she often marked shifts of thought/subject by leaving several blank spaces at the end of a line, many shifts remain unmarked because they coincide with the far edge of the page. Second, Dickinson's idiosyncratic punctuation, especially her dashes, often makes it difficult even to say where a given sentence concludes. Rather than dividing prose texts into sentences and paragraphs, I have chosen to divide them into "passages," an inclusive term designating "phrases," "sentences," and "paragraphs." In those prose texts where there is no clear division of text into smaller units&#8212;a common situation in the rough-copy prose drafts&#8212;the notation in <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element reads simply: "lines, prose." Finally, in instances in which the text shifts between verse and prose, as many of Dickinson's letters do, the locations of the shifts are recorded with a notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element. In addition to dividing, wherever possible, Dickinson's letters into passages, <hi rend="small caps">EDs</hi> also delimit the different spaces or levels of a letter: the date (when added by Dickinson), the salutation, the closing, the signature, and any postscripts following the body of the letter.</p>
            <p>The fragments, almost all of which are interpreted as generically undecidable, are rarely meaningfully divided below the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> level; the notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element for fragments reads simply: "lines."</p>
            <p>The question of how best to divide Dickinson's poems, letters, and fragments in order to reveal their linguistic and physical structures has not been satisfactorily resolved and is a matter for continued scholarly discussion and debate. The potential of SGML to represent different structures within a single text will almost certainly offer interesting alternatives to the present schema.</p>

         <p>I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of John Lancaster, Curator of Special Collections, Amherst College Library; Leslie Morris, Curator of Manuscripts, Houghton Library, Harvard University; Roberta Zonghi, Curator, Rare Books, Boston Public Library; Patricia Willis, Curator, Yale Collection of American Literature, The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library; Ralph W. Franklin, Director, The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library; Rodney Phillips, Curator, Special Collections, The Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, New York Public Library; Mark R. Farrell, Curator, Robert H. Taylor Collection, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library; Derick Dreher, Curator of Manuscripts, The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library; Elizabeth E. Fuller, Librarian, The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library; Jason A. Staloff, Curatorial Assistant, The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library; Phillip Cronenwett, Head of Special Collections, Dartmouth College Library; and Daniel Lombardo, Curator, the Jones Library, Inc. Without the cooperation of these individuals and institutions, this archive of Dickinson's fragments and related texts could not have been completed. In addition to permitting me to examine the original manuscripts of all of the documents included here, they responded to my questions about the history and contents of their collections and permitted images of the manuscripts in their collections to be reproduced here. I am also indebted to Donald Oresman, who generously granted my request to include a Dickinson manuscript from his private collection in this work. Cindy Dickinson provided the image of the desk from the Dickinson Homestead and permitted me to reproduce it.</p>
         <p>From the outset this archive has been a collaborative project. I am particularly indebted to Susan Whitlock, editor, the University of Michigan Press; John Price-Wilkin, Head, Digital Library Production Services, University of Michigan; Christina Powell, Coordinator, Humanities Text Initiative, University of Michigan; Nigel Kerr, SGML Systems Librarian, University of Michigan; and Alan Pagliere, SGML Technologist, University of Michigan for their unstinting help in translating my largely theoretical ideas concerning the representation of Dickinson's late fragments into a new and ever-changing medium&#8212;the electronic archive&#8212;that could accommodate them. Similarly, I am grateful to Patrick Bryant (Ph.D. candidate, Georgia State University) for his rigorous approach to the diplomatic transcription of documents and to Andy Rogers (Web Programmer at iXL) for his innovative design work. Marcia Smith, Lori Howard, and Elizabeth Gratch provided expert copy-editing and proofreading assistance.</p>
         <p>I have relied upon generous assistance from numerous textual and Dickinson scholars. I am especially grateful to D. C. Greetham and W. Speed Hill, both of whom responded to requests for bibliographical advice; to Jana Dambrogio, for her work on the Emily Dickinson MSS Condition Survey (Houghton Library, Harvard University); to Ralph W. Franklin, Martha Nell Smith, and Ellen Hart for their assistance in identifying editorial notations on Dickinson's manuscripts and, more generally, for their willingness to share their ideas about Dickinson's manuscripts with me; and to Susan Howe and Jerome J. McGann, whose vision and encouragement sustained me during the five years of work committed to this project. My indebtedness to the scholarship of Thomas H. Johnson and Jay Leyda is too deep for a simple acknowledgment and is inscribed everywhere in this project.</p>
         <p>My research was supported by a grant from the Bibliographical Society of America (1997) and by two research grants from Georgia State University (1996, 1998). "'Most Arrows': Autonomy and Intertextuality in Emily Dickinson's Late Fragments" was originally published in <title>Text</title> 10 (1997): 41&#8211;72, and permission to reprint the essay here was kindly granted by the editor, W.

Leaves following the first leaf of a manuscript (or, often, the reverse side of a manuscript) are identified by the catalog number plus a letter (a, b, c, etc.). The numbers on the manuscripts at Amherst College were assigned by Jay Leyda, who arranged and described the materials while they were housed in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C., in 1957. Leyda assigned catalog numbers first to what he understood to constitute manuscript volumes (80&#8211;95), then to what he understood to be unbound poems and poem fragments (96&#8211;540), and, finally, to those documents he considered letters, drafts, and prose fragments (541&#8211;1012). The arrangement within each correspondence is intended by Leyda to be chronological. Leyda's cataloging is very consistent. At times, however, he used more than one catalog number to distinguish among discrete texts on a given document (e.g., A 351 / 352); at other times, Leyda did not assign a catalog number/letter to the reverse side of a document; in these instances, I have added a "v" to the catalog number to indicate a reverse or verso of a leaf or fragment.]</item>

"Most Arrows": Autonomy and Intertextuality in Emily Dickinson's Late Fragments
         </head>
         <epigraph>
            <p>The best company for me is she or he who is in touch with the instant, in writing. . . . A bird-catcher of instants.  &#8212;H&#233;l&#232;ne Cixous</p>
         </epigraph>
         <p>Two passageways, two invitations, open within Dickinson's late work. The first extends from Dickinson to a sometimes named, sometimes anonymous, outside reader; the second stretches from a questioning alterity back to the writer who, in trying to meet it, bypasses the reader and the established codes of communication and returns to a luminous yet illegible form of private notation. The letters and poem-messages of the 1870s and 1880s, although already marked by a fanning out of specific address that has often been mistaken for clairvoyance, are still legible; they may be intercepted, even answered, by a vanishing reader. The fragments, on the other hand, a mob of traces, some in verse, others in prose, if we prefer a distinction that is by this time in extremis, belong to the pre-scriptive processes of thought or, rather, since these are "retrieveless," to that moment when the words that lie in wait for thoughts suddenly ambush them, tracing a path for them in a writing that briefly keeps pace with thinking&#8212;perhaps even outstrips it.<note n="1">The word "retrieveless" is Dickinson's. Her first recorded use of it is in fascicle 25 (1862) in the poem beginning "I tried to think a lonelier | thing." It appears in two other poems: "It bloomed and dropt, | a Single Noon -" and "The Frost was | never seen -."</note> Together and separately they inaugurate a lyric nondiscourse scattered in an infinity of singular articulations and manifested finally as an <hi rend="italics">absence d'oeuvre.</hi> Untitled, unauthorized, and extrageneric, these whispers at the outer limits of Dickinson's work ask "Where do I exit and go and how do I proceed?"<note n="2">The question is Novalis's and, more generally, that of the Jena Romantics. Yet it is also, if obliquely, the question posed by Dickinson's late writings.</note>

         <p>A reader enters the scene of composition long after the author's departure. Dickinson's writing table, a small mahogany desk eighteen inches square with a single drawer just deep enough for ink pots and stationery, stands cleared of unruly remains, exorcised of ambiguities. It appears before us like a blank page. Yet Dickinson's manuscripts, the material witnesses of her late aesthetic itinerary, offer striking testimony about the spectacular turbulence and commotion&#8212;the pandemonium&#8212;that attended the act of composition. In some cases it appears that a fragment of text was composed on an already torn scrap of paper drawn up or beyond its original use at the moment of inspiration; in other cases Dickinson seems to have begun by composing a block of lines on a sheet of paper and then cut or torn most of the sheet away. Later, several random lines saved for years might be pinned together, re-associated along the lines of rhyme or theme. Millicent Todd Bingham, whose privilege was never to see Dickinson while she was alive, left this beautiful, accurate description of her late textual body: <q type="block" direct="unspecified">When first discovered [the manuscripts] looked impossible&#8212;a jumble of words on odds and ends of paper, some of it crumpled or torn. . . . There are pink scraps, blue and yellow scraps . . . all . . . written in pencil and all in the late handwriting. . . . The strokes are sometimes faint and the lines often overlap so that the words overtake one another as if written in the dark. Indeed, some thoughts are potent enough to have roused her from sleep.<note n="3">Millicent Todd Bingham, "Prose Fragments of Emily Dickinson," <title>New England Quarterly</title> 28 (September 1955): 293; and "Introduction," <title>Bolts of Melody</title>, edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and Millicent Todd Bingham (New York: Harper, 1945), xv.</note>

         <p>Today the manuscripts of more than one hundred of the late fragments are stored in the vault of the Amherst College Library, Special Collections. The silent interior of an interior, a complex of protected spaces, the archive would have fascinated Dickinson. Founded on the twinned ideas of memory and order, on the one hand, the archive offers, on the other, a shifting collection of pieces out of place, the remains of a heterogeneous estate that resist reintegration into any single, perfect order. In the archive even the most fragile, secret, or disconcerting elements of a writer's activity are carefully preserved. Here, where the present is suspended, the reader is projected into another time, another place. The questions that draw me into the archive also (with)draw me into the rifts between history and memory, authorial intention and textual revelation . . . </p>
         <p>I open a box filled with fragments, "lost events." Inside folders, pressed between leaves, I find perfect quatrains beside barely legible lists of words held together with straight pins . . . I am under the spell of traces, strange comminglings . . . </p>
         <p>With two clearly identified exceptions, the fragments that have survived amid so many hazards and losses were composed in the 1870s and 1880s.<note n="4">The two surviving fragments that may have been composed in the 1850s and 1860s are "With the sincere spite of a <hi rend="underlined">Woman."</hi> and "I send a Violet for Libby." Both are in ink, and the handwriting places them among Dickinson's early writings. Millicent Todd Bingham suggests that both messages were mailed but later somehow found their way back into Dickinson's papers.</note> According to David Higgins, however, repeated phrases and sentences in compositions written in the mid-1850s suggest that an earlier collection of fragments, no longer extant, once existed.<note n="5">See David Higgins, "Introduction: Emily Dickinson's Prose," in <title>A Portrait of Emily Dickinson: The Poet and Her Prose</title> (New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1967), 3&#8211;24. Higgins's <title>Portrait</title> is the only full-length study of Dickinson's prose available.</note> If Higgins's hypothesis is correct, then two groups of fragments, composed twenty years apart, mark the boundaries of Dickinson's high poetic style as well as the boundaries of the forty manuscript volumes, the first of which appears quite suddenly around 1858 and the last of which was completed less than ten years later, in 1866, when Dickinson closed the doors of her private bindery forever.<note n="5a">I am grateful to Ellen Hart for her suggestion of the term "manuscript volumes" to describe Dickinson's bound groups of poems, and I have substituted the term "manuscript volume" for the more commonly used "fascicle" and "packet" throughout. As Hart pointed out to me in conversation, the terms "fascicle" and "packet" were not, after all, Dickinson's, but her editors. Moreover, Dickinson's editors do not always use the terms "fascicle" and "packet" consistently: at times, the terms "fascicle" or "packet" are applied to groups of poems stab-bound by Dickinson; at times to the groups of poems held together with brass fasteners; and, at still other times, to loose sheets apparently sorted into groups for binding. Here the term "manuscript volume" refers exclusively to groups of poems stab-bound and tied together, or to groups of poems held together with brass fasteners.</note> Although Dickinson's practice in the late 1850s and early 1860s of transcribing and binding final and semifinal drafts of her poems into manuscript volumes&#8212;at which time she presumably jettisoned rough drafts&#8212;makes it impossible to establish a definitive chronology of composition, it is nonetheless clear that during these years the onrush of vision was almost alarming. In the annus mirabilis of 1863, Dickinson composed or at least copied no less than 366 poems into manuscript volumes&#8212;almost one quarter of her extant oeuvre. "Her creative energies," wrote Thomas Johnson, "were at flood, and she was being overwhelmed by forces which she could not control."<note n="6">Thomas H. Johnson, "Creating the Poems," in <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson.</title> 3 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1955), xviii. See R. W. Franklin's introduction <title>(The Poems of Emily Dickinson.</title>  Variorum ed. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1998), where he contests the earlier theory that 1862 was Dickinson's watershed year for poetic production, and instead posits that the peak year was 1863.</note> After 1870, the "crisis" over, Dickinson appears to enter a prolonged period of diminished or blocked productivity. In what would be the final phase of her work she continues to draft poems and messages, but she no longer copies them onto uniform sheets of paper or binds them into manuscript volumes, and the great majority remain in the worksheet stage. Fragments now proliferate.<note n="7">Dickinson scholars often use the terms "early," "middle," and "late" to refer to Dickinson's style periods. Yet so far there has been very little subtle analysis of the three style periods&#8212;the elements characteristic of each&#8212;and still less analysis of the causes for the transitions from one style period to another and of the dynamic interplay of early, middle, and late style elements in her poems and letters. In his foreword to <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1955) Thomas H. Johnson writes: "Emily Dickinson was born to her talent but she felt no dedication to her art until she was about twenty-eight years old, in 1858. By 1862 her creative impulse was at flood tide, and by 1865 the greater part of her poetic energies were spent. She continued to write poetry until her death in 1886, when she was fifty-five years old, and many of her later verses are among her great creations. But after 1870 her poems are relatively few in number and were often composed for an occasion and for the friends to whom they were sent." In "Creating the Poems," Johnson's introduction to the 1855 variorum, he adds, "Her interest in the packet method of assembling the verses . . . coincides with the years of fullest productivity." R. W. Franklin, in his introduction to <title>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</title> (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1981), refines Johnson's periodization schema somewhat by including a more detailed portrait of Dickinson's patterns of copying and binding. Although he does not undertake a full analysis of the style elements in the bound poems or of the stylistic changes within the manuscript volumes, his work makes possible an particularly rich analysis of Dickinson's "middle" or "high" period. The full significance of even this major style period will not be grasped, however, until it is seen in relationship to the early and especially the late style periods.</note>            
         </p>
         <p>So far, these fragments have been read as signs of the failure or, at the very least, the intermittency, of Dickinson's late vision. Yet, if the stockpiling of a (lost) group of fragments in the mid-1850s was preparatory to Dickinson's first major aesthetic and stylistic shift, her break into poetry and bookmaking, is it not also possible that the accumulation of a significant body of fragments in the 1870s and 1880s announces the onset of another, further stylistic crisis that has long gone unrecognized because its extremity has been alternately explained and overtaken by the biographical crisis of Dickinson's death in 1886? Rather than signifying the inevitable decline of creative energies, the late, extant collection of fragments may mark the moment when, having simultaneously reached the outermost boundaries of the prevailing style of the 1860s and the limits of the codex book, Dickinson was once again entering a transitional term of profound experimentation and instability. Here, outside the order of the manuscript volumes, and beyond the locus of power, ambition was redirected and writing&#8212;a writing beyond the ending&#8212;governed by a new "eros of inquiry."<note n="8">Jerome A. Miller, <title>In the Throe of Wonder: Intimations of the Sacred in a Post-Modern World</title> (Albany: State U of New York P, 1992), 176.</note> Marked by their remarkable and unprecedented exploration of the dialectics of exile and joy, dispossession and delight, the fragments are en route to a place they will never arrive. Linked to what is in transit, <hi rend="italics">disappearing,</hi> they resemble fingerprints, the light touches of the artist who, having submitted fully to the process of writing and constantly reaching new decisions, no longer thinks of finishing any particular text.</p>
         <p>How can we retrace where they came from and in what direction they are traveling? If the metaphysician, in search of the distant eschaton, relies on his powers of farsightedness, the textual geneticist favors nearsightedness, covets closer, more intimate discoveries. Sifting through the masses of papers, studying fragments day after day, the details of paper and pencil seem to dilate before my eyes until the unreflective surface of the library desk becomes a mysterious light table. </p>

         <p>Even in the context of Dickinson's own oeuvre the fragments may at first seem sui generis, and their irregularity continues to be reflected in their bibliographical status as textual fugitives and as "luxuries in the field of knowledge," fascinating and yet dispensable. Mistakenly called "aphorisms" and "epigrams"&#8212;as if Dickinson's style (thought) had become terse, lapidary, and bounded instead of simply sudden, exorbitant in its artlessness and its claims to freedom&#8212;what these writings are remains radically undecidable: they may be passwords to unknown and still unwritten poems, codas to a lost vision, or singular transcriptions of the way in which Dickinson "heard" poetically. Composed in neither the past nor the future tense but in what might be called the process tense, many of them reveal the kinesthetics of writing-as-dictation, the inscription of <hi rend="italics">energeia,</hi> in which the hand that has begun to move across the page is seized and directed by an unknown agency, an other who, as Dickinson wrote, "comes" and "over takes the mind" (A 879). Fragments, like glossolalia, "cross over the boundary lines of ordinary language," abolishing all bonds with the methods and measures of discourse: they write themselves.<note n="9">Paul Zumthor, "The Voice and the Text," <title>New Literary History</title> 16 (Autumn 1984): 75.</note>

            Of the more than one hundred extant fragments I took as my point of departure, approximately half descend to us as exilic passages. In the more fully developed of these passages, Dickinson may be seen ranging freely about in the open spaces between or outside stanzas where writing becomes a form of radical essaying, a way of rigorously avoiding the limits of the mind. Here a writer's "exploration of scattered centers of thought" is graphically translated onto the paper's surface in the form of scribblings in the margins, cancelations, blocks of texts divided or connected with dashes, ellipses suggesting the momentary eclipse of inspiration or only language.<note n="10">Serge Tisseron, "All Writing Is Drawing: The Spatial Development of the Manuscript," <title>Yale French Studies</title> 84 (1994): 40.</note> Here, at last, the extreme contraction characteristic of the earlier style periods is unworked in a language of pure hypothesis, in fragments upon which we have no purchase. Their subject appears to be some kind of transition&#8212;the approach of death, the break of day&#8212;whose accomplishment cannot be effected by reasoners, making their careful way from proof to proof, but is instead endlessly postponed in order to render permanent the experience of the threshold. This Dickinson, a post-poetical Dickinson whose late, acute investigations are pensÃ©es on the order of Pascal and Wittgenstein, passes by, still unmet a century after her death.

         <p>More common by far than the investigative passages cited here, however, are those fragments that descend to us like solitary outriders haunted by communion. Shimmering and brief, "eviscerated," as Emerson said, "of care," vulnerability is the mark of their existence. If they are the nuclei of poems or messages in a state of pure potentiality and in search of conditions yet to be defined, they are also often bolder than Dickinson's more finished texts. Like souls, neither touching nor mingling, never composing a set, these positionless fragments depict the beauties of transition and isolation at once.

         <p>Sometime in 1884 Dickinson wrote on a small slip of paper the words <figure entity="a287"/>and attached the slip to an unfinished draft of a message-poem (A 637) to Susan Dickinson composed on the anniversary of her youngest child's death. The slip repeated the first two words of the message's closing lines: "Most Arrows | slay but whom | they strike -." <figure entity="a637"/>Sometime later, for reasons unknown, the slip was unpinned. Like this "arrow text" that both pierces and emanates from the heart of a heartbreaking message, many of the apparently autonomous fragments may have at one time been linked to other, still unidentified texts. And in some instances it is the "arrows," rather than the texts to which they were at one time linked, that have alone returned to us, sharp reminders that even a complete inventory of Dickinson's extant writings can never reveal how many more have been lost.</p>

            Finally, within the constellation of Dickinson's late writings are those fragments that are the augurers of more complete and present texts. Again and again, as if poems, letters, and fragments communicated with one another telepathically, a line or phrase from a fragment may reappear, often in a slightly altered form, in the body of a poem, a message, or even another fragment. In 1955, when Millicent Todd Bingham first printed a selection of Dickinson's fragments in the <title>New England Quarterly,</title> she cautioned: "To trace the course of an idea from seed to flower, whether blossoming in a poem or a letter to a friend, would be a devious but enlightening study, a challenge to ingenuity and patience."<note n="12">Millicent Todd Bingham, "Emily Dickinson's Prose Fragments," <title>New England Quarterly</title> 28 (September 1955): 293&#8211;94.</note> Yet the painstaking&#8212;and ongoing&#8212;effort to identify all such trace fragments and link them with the messages and poems in which they appear will not effect any lasting closure: neither residents nor aliens, neither lost nor found, these trace fragments are caught between their attraction to a specific, bounded text and their desire to continue the search for an open, absolute text that can never achieve positive existence. A truly devious and enlightening reading must therefore attend to the mystery of the encounter between poems, letters, and fragments, listening especially to the ways in which the fragments, like leitmotifs, the turns and returns of a melody, both change the modalities of the compositions in which they momentarily take asylum and carry these leitmotifs beyond the "finished" compositions into a freer, often more amplified, space.

         </figure>
         <p>Inside this poem a fragment is secreted, sealed into it like a light. Even without knowing in advance that it is there, close reading quite often uncovers it. For the fragment is the flashpoint of the text's beginning, a "quickening word" that comes unbidden and that turns our thinking inside out. Among Dickinson's remains, on a scrap of brown wrapping paper, we find this excruciating offering:</p>
         <figure entity="a112">
            <figDesc>focus 17: A 112. About 1883 or 1884? Lines penciled on a scrap (60 x 96 mm) of brown wrapping paper.</figDesc>
         </figure>
         <p>In this instance the fragment exists in two textual spaces at once: in the poem-message as a variant or rhyming trace of its final line and as an autonomous lyric throe not jettisoned once the poem is finished but translated into another economy altogether. To be sure something is negotiated between the fragment and the poem held spellbound together for an instant&#8212;not least of all the poem's boundaries. But, unlike the lists of variants that stream after so many of Dickinson's poems of the 1860s, this fragment is neither visually nor syntactically subordinated to the poem proper. On the contrary, "A Woe | of Ecstasy" rhymes with its variant and reenters the drive of writing&#8212;a "presence after presentness."<note n="13">George Steiner, <title>Real Presences</title> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1989), 147.</note> Only the barest signs of a struggle remain&#8212;three dashes rend the text at the points where the fragment migrates into the poem and then disengages from it again, while along the top edge a light horizontal line, like the lines Dickinson sometimes drew to separate the body of a poem from its variants and, later, to divide tiny increments of thought, is a graphic sign that these lines were once the last lines of a poem since torn away. Now the "end," the variant, has become a new beginning. Outside the labor of the poem's argument, alone again, the fragment seeks the exact conditions for poetry and becomes pure potential; moreover, by reversing the conditions of inwardness, it extends, exponentially, the original impetus of both poem and oeuvre toward nonclosure.</p>
         <p>A trope, or turn, "A Woe | of Ecstasy" does not so much orient the poem in which it appears as a citation as illuminate the inner contradictoriness&#8212;the paradoxes, the antinomies&#8212;out of which (Dickinson's) poetry is engendered. Again and again, fragments and their traces, like opposing poles, pull away from each other.</p>

         <p>And the poem, constituted out of such fragments, arrow-texts aimed in different directions, must perforce break apart again, if only to demonstrate that it, too, is only an excerpt, a citation from a text without beginning or end, a thought subject to be thought again and again. </p>
         <p>Thus, in 1877, after "finishing" the poem "After all | Birds have | been investigated | and laid aside" and copying it onto a sheet of embossed stationery, Dickinson suddenly began to unwork it, to write it apart.

         <p>Similarly, in 1874, approximately ten years after making a fair-copy of "A Drop fell on the | Apple Tree -" and three years after completing a fair-copy of "'Remember me' | implored the Thief!" Dickinson suddenly scribbled down two fragments from these poems on the back of an envelope: "Myself compu- | ted were they | Pearls | What Legacy | could be" and "Oh Magnanimity - | My Visitor in | Paradise."</p>

         </figure>
         <p> Why did she suddenly remember (differently) a few lines from two poems written years apart and dash them down, together? At what instant did two increments of thought, never before linked, suddenly appear on the same empty horizon, drawing two fragments&#8212;and thus also two poems&#8212;into relation? And why, after a decade, were the poems turned back into fragments, arrow-texts, shot, as Blake writes, into the "airy way"?</p>
         <p id="MA004">
            Although the random and ephemeral thoughts Dickinson scribbled down on pieces of paper during the final decade of her life have long since turned into printed words, these late fragments remain undomesticatable: they cannot simply be contained in appendices or, as in the case of the trace-fragments, annexed to the more familiar world of the "finished" compositions in which they are held, spellbound, for a moment. Incised not only into Dickinson's poems but also into her letters, which, particularly at the end of her life, are less clearly "fine and private" messages addressed to single, identifiable recipients than accounts of her sudden encounters with awe, fragments, like quotations of other voices, continually set these texts adrift in other, more unpredictable directions.<note n="14">According to David Higgins, "It was only after her father's death in 1874 that the several variant styles began to approach a single manner. In her last years only a few of her most intimate correspondents . . . received letters distinctly separate from a general style"; see <title>A Portrait of Emily Dickinson: A Poet and Her Prose</title> (New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1967), 12.</note> In successive drafts of her final&#8212;missing&#8212;letter to Helen Hunt Jackson, for instance, in the midst of composition in 1885, three discrete fragments, one on a torn fragment of stationery, another on two fragments of envelope held together with a straight pin, and a third on a torn piece of paper bag attached to a narrow strip of white wrapping paper with a pin, are at first carefully transported into messages continually shifting between "prose" and "poetry."

         <p>Yet within the interstices of the drafts that seem to repatriate and master them, the fragments continue to mark the place where the amanuensis comes, slipping between registers in a voice at once immediate and alien, writing the text apart. Never simply in league with the letter proper or with the intentions of the letter-writer toward the recipient, they will (have always already) "let go" of the text proper, liquidating their connections with both text and interlocutor in order to acquire additional freedom. The poem-message or letter, ignited by such instants of pure departure, may at any moment revolt against the sovereignty of singular address, taking off from the startled recipient in another direction.</p>

         <p>The instantaneous translation from one condition into another radically different one defines the experience of Dickinson's late, ecstatic writings. At last poems (or letters) seem to "rub their eyes" before the fragments as before something too luminous or something moving at too dazzling a velocity. For, like the reader, poems and letters belong to the "posthistory of suddenness," while fragments, variants of the instant of aesthetic appearance, embody the very structure of suddenness.<note n="15">For a provocative discussion of "suddenness," see Karl Heinz Bohrer, <title>Suddenness: On the Moment of Aesthetic Appearance,</title> translated by Ruth Crowley (New York: Columbia UP, 1994).</note> Their textual status as "fugitives" or "exceptions" is related not only to their insusceptibility to categorization but, paradoxically, to their migration between radically different texts and, finally, to their capacity to survive outside the texts that host them and beyond, too, the mind of the author and her system of intentions. Five sets of pinholes along the left, right, and bottom edges of A 821 attest to the frequency of such textual migrations. Pinning and unpinning fragments, Dickinson continually divined new poems; reckless with final energies, she accompanied them as far as she could.</p>
         <p>In the end the exceptions, the fragments, may reveal more than the rule about the state of Dickinson's art. Located at the outermost limits of her work, in the unfamiliar and largely unprobed region of the document, they illuminate the requirements of her aesthetics of radical inquiry and attest to the possibility of a thought no longer guaranteed by unity. Dickinson's final style is thus the style of transition itself. The stunning range of formal and expressive problems she explored in the 1860s, and which can be studied through a close reading of the manuscript volumes, were not in the end resolvable. Most important, as Susan Howe, Sharon Cameron, and others have observed, Dickinson was unable to resolve the problem of variant readings.<note n="16">See, for example, Susan Howe, "These Flames and Generosities of the Heart: Dickinson and the Illogic of Sumptuary Values," <title>Sulfur</title> 28 (1991): 134&#8211;55; and Sharon Cameron, <title>Choosing Not Choosing: Dickinson's Fascicles</title> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1992).</note> At first she may have thought to contain not only poems but variants by binding them into manuscript volumes. Later, when the variants threatened to carry both poems and manuscript volumes away, she returned to the single page. The sets, composed in the wake of the manuscript volumes, show Dickinson working on single sheets of stationery, to which she occasionally pinned slips of paper containing overflow lines or variants. Finally, in the 1870s and 1880s the variants and breakaway lines successfully sued for their autonomy. The often violent contest played out in the manuscript volumes between a line (a word) and its alternate is at last eased by Dickinson's decision to make all parties&#8212;poem or letter, fragment and variant&#8212;equally autonomous, equally transient. Rather then resolve the issue of variation, then, perhaps the central formal issue of her work, Dickinson carries it to extremes, at last choosing to exit the work in order to enter a language of pure risk. Sifting through the manuscripts of these fragments and drafts, the reader receives a profound intimation of the freedom and joy of that final scene of writing. Having abandoned the institution of "authorship" early on in her writing life, Dickinson was able to set in motion a work without beginning or ending. The abbreviation of the late style (thought) must not blind us to the profligate gesture behind it. The fragments&#8212;the work in throes&#8212;scatter it in all directions at once.</p>
         <p>Everything must be redefined in their wake.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <p>Literary scholarship concerns itself with works as finished products, as texts that lack nothing and in which nothing is superfluous. . . . That is why the fragment, which does not fulfill the presuppositions of wholeness, is not a popular object for literary scholarship and perhaps not even a possible one. The fragment cannot be controlled. Thus the encounter of literary scholarship with the fragment creates a contradictory situation. Either the discourse about the fragment must deny it as what it is and falsely make it into a whole, or it must itself be put into question in its claim to master the text. . . . The fragment can only be approached by a discourse with no claim to power.  &#8212;Hans-Jost Frey</p>

            <p>
               The core of this archive consists of eighty-two documents carrying over one hundred fragmentary texts composed by Emily Dickinson.<note n="17">The precise number of <hi rend="italics">texts,</hi> as opposed to <hi rend="italics">documents,</hi> is withheld, since that number is based on the interpretation of textual boundaries and is thus subject to change.</note> The criteria for inclusion used in the current version of <title>Radical Scatters</title> are as follows: all of the fragments featured as "core" texts have been assigned composition dates of roughly 1870 or after; all of the core fragments are materially discrete (that is, fragments have not been excerpted from other compositions); and all of the core fragments are inherently autonomous, <hi rend="italics">whether or not they also appear as traces in other texts,</hi> and inherently resistant to claims of closure. Excluded from this version of the archive are fair- and rough-copy message- or message-drafts to identified or unidentified recipients; brief but complete poem drafts; extra-literary texts such as recipes and addresses; quotations and passages copied or paraphrased from other writers' works; and textual remains preserved only accidentally because Dickinson used the same writing surface to compose other texts. Two apparent exceptions to the above criteria require explanation. First, in instances in which a message-draft also exists as an independent fragment, perhaps as a pensÃ©e or meditation, the text has been included among the archive's core documents (e.g., A 802). Second, in instances in which a passage has been scissored or otherwise excerpted from a longer composition, possibly a letter since lost or destroyed, and preserved as an independent fragment, the excerpted text has been included among the archive's core documents (e.g., A 746). Finally, the identification of "fragments" is especially vexed when a "fragment" is associated with a constellation of texts&#8212;e.g., the trial beginnings, re-workings or repairs of textual situations, rough-copy drafts, intermediate-copy drafts, fair-copy drafts&#8212; of a given "poem" because in many cases the distinction between a "fragment" and a part (group of lines, stanza) of a poem is purely arbitrary. In instances where there are several possible "fragments" in a given textual constellation I have in general selected the briefest and most difficult to classify text for principal representation here, while also attempting to specify its relationships to the other texts in the constellation. My primary aim here is to foreground Dickinson's extrageneric compositions, not to define the "fragment" &#8212;surely an impossible project&#8212;and it should be clear that I consider the term "fragment" itself inadequate.<note n="17a">My thinking about the fragment is greatly indebted to the Hans-Jost Frey's thinking in <title>Interruptions,</title> translated with an introduction by Georgia Albert (Albany: SUNY Press, 1996). In "Fragment Whole," Frey begins to elucidate the paradox of the fragment's autonomy and openness: "The fragment is neither a whole nor a part. . .  . If it were a whole the fragment would not be a fragment any more; if it were a part, it could be completed and made into a whole. Because it is neither a whole nor a part, it remains resistant to closure" (26).</note> Ultimately, the "fragments" included here will be fully revealed only when they are seen in the context of Dickinson's complete writings. This archive is but one possible point of departure for an electronic archive of all of Dickinson's writings.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to these core texts, the archive's primary materials include fifty-three poems, letters, and other writings with direct links to the fragments. The manuscripts of the fragments are housed at the Amherst College Library, Special Collections. The manuscripts of the related texts are divided among seven libraries&#8212;Amherst College Library (29); Houghton Library (12); Boston Public Library (6); New York Public Library (1); Jones Library, Inc. (1); Princeton University Library (1); Yale University Library (1); and The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library (1)&#8212;and one private collection (Oresman [1]).</p>
            <p>Dickinson's fragments which, temporally speaking, appear at a late moment in the trajectory of her writing, also appear at the outermost limits of her production. Like the limit-works of other writers&#8212;Kafka's <title>Conversation Slips,</title> Pascal's <title>PensÃ©es,</title> and Wittgenstein's <title>Remarks on Colour</title> come to mind&#8212;Dickinson's fragments are essentially private texts, belonging to the space of creation rather than communication.<note n="18">For an interesting discussion of these two "spaces," see Louis Hay, "History or Genesis?" <title>Yale French Studies</title> 89 (1996): 198.</note> Never prepared for publication, perhaps never even meant to be read by anyone except the scriptor herself, they are not "works" but, rather, symptoms of the processes of composition, data&#8212;aleatory, contingent&#8212;of the work of writing. Nothing is less likely than that Dickinson's fragments constitute a unified collection of texts. On the contrary, the connections among them are at most transient. If, at times, it seems that one or two or even several act as "strange attractors," drawing near to one another, forming a small constellation, at other times each appears as a separate, antinomic text, remote from the others, unassimilated and unassimilatable to a larger figure. In <title>Radical Scatters,</title> the fragments, bibliographical "escapes," serve as a point of entry into the mass of late, unbound, heterogeneous documents found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Although my intention has been to include all of the late fragments possessing aesthetic or formal integrity, the list of contents must be considered provisional rather than definitive. In the future, some of the documents included in the present archive will slip outside of it, while others, not yet marked as fragments, may enter it, producing not new collections but, rather, unforeseen and anomalous orders.<note n="18a">The following documents, for instance, identified in R. W. Franklin's <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1998), should be included in the body of this archive: A 135 / 136; A 173; A 210a; A 266 / 267; and A 429.

            <head type="general section heading">Structure of the Archive</head>
            <p>
               <title>Radical Scatters</title> offers three different representations of the archive's primary materials: graphic files containing high-quality facsimiles of the core fragments and related texts; graphic files containing diplomatic transcriptions of the fragments and related texts; and files containing SGML-marked e.texts of the fragments and related texts. A file of "Control Texts" contains facsimiles of examples of texts selected from the realm of Dickinson's late papers but not considered as belonging to the set of "core" fragments featured in the archive. The texts in this file have been included to help clarify the criteria used to determine whether or not a given text belongs in the present configuration of "late fragments," and, conversely, to foreground the difficulty of definitively demarcating the boundaries between Dickinson's late fragments and other bibliographically ambiguous compositions found among her papers. </p>
            <p>Several paratexts&#8212;including a comprehensive "Site Map" that offers a visual overview of the levels of the archive, indices of the documents in the archive arranged by type, libraries of codes and search paths, a library of Dickinson's "hands," files of bibliographical and critical glosses on the fragments and related texts, and an appendix of the earliest printed sources of Dickinson's fragments&#8212;help to orient the reader and facilitate a large number of critical and analytic operations. All of the primary materials in the archive are organized for full electronic search and analysis, and both primary and paratextual materials are embedded in a complex hypertextual environment that makes possible the study of macrogenetic phenomena (i.e., phenomena occurring across the documents in the archive) and the analysis of microgenetic details (i.e., the salient features of individual documents). While the non-hierarchical or decentered structure of the archive reflects the fragments' irreducible singularity and insusceptibility to collection in a "book," the archive's system of nonlinear links reveals, on the other hand, their openness to and participation in multiple textual constellations and/or contingent orders. </p>
            <p>Finally, <title>Radical Scatters</title> is fundamentally historical&#8212;that is, it is capable of development, innovation, and transformation. The archive will be updated approximately every two years. During the next two years (the first phase of updating), I will identify additional documents for inclusion among the archive's core materials and test the strengths and weaknesses of the archive's design and deep structure in order to make appropriate revisions.<note n="19">
                  <title>Radical Scatters</title> presents a relatively small number of Dickinson's writings; its focus, moreover, is those writings&#8212;the fragments of the 1870s and 1880s&#8212;that have traditionally been treated as supplementary and even subordinate to her work. The structural principles underlying the organization of the archive's files and the representation of the documents contained within it may not be applicable, without serious modification, to an electronic archive of Dickinson's bound poems or, for different reasons, to an archive of her correspondences. Thus, <title>Radical Scatters</title> is best understood as an attempt to develop a new paradigm for editing Dickinson's most bibliographically problematic texts and as a testing ground for editing concepts, some of which may later be applied to the editing of her more canonical writings. Editing and encoding Dickinson's late fragments will help to identify problematic issues in the editing and encoding of all of her writings and to indicate the degree of standardization still required to create a hypermedia archive of Dickinson's complete writings. It may do much more. For, as scholars in diverse fields of inquiry have recognized, limit-works seem capable of illuminating with particular clarity the principles at the core of an artist's production. In Dickinson's case the fragments are the latest and furthest affirmation of a centrifugal impulse, a gravitation away from the center and toward the limit, that is expressed at every level and in every phase of her work.

            <p>The manuscript is the text's "other scene," the record, only partly discursive, of a vision that cannot ever be completely decoded or encoded. Its refusal to disclose itself fully and at once reminds us of the perpetual need for a method (and a theory) of translation attentive to the dialectics of access and otherness, darkness and divination, writing and seeing. On the surfaces of Dickinson's manuscripts the turbulence of the mind expresses itself in a series of legible signs and illegible marks&#8212;in letters, dashes, pointings, strike-outs, pen tests, blurs, blank spaces. Some of the signs, especially the alphabetic symbols, we believe we know how to decipher and interpret; others, such as the angled dashes and flying quotation marks, we recognize as expressive, but interpret and represent awkwardly; still others, not signs, even, but subsemiotic marks made accidentally by the author, time, or the elements, we cannot interpret, though we sense intuitively that they, too, are part of the manuscript's environment and contribute in some way to its signification. The charged interplay of intentional signs and accidental marks renders Dickinson's manuscripts iconic and suggests the inherent connection in her work between the iconic and the immediate as well as the connection between the iconic and the "logic of difference."<note n="21">See especially Stephen Leo Carr, "Illuminated Printing: Toward a Logic of Difference," and Robert N. Essick, "How Blake's Body Means," in <title>Unnam'd Forms: Blake and Textuality,</title> edited by Nelson Hilton and Thomas A. Vogler. Berkeley: U of California P, 1986. 177&#8211;217.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Following Peter Robinson's seminal work on the transcription of primary textual sources for the computer, I have approached the act of transcribing these documents "not as an act of substitution, but as a series of acts of translation from one semiotic system . . . to another." Like all acts of translation, these acts of transcription are "fundamentally incomplete and fundamentally interpretive."<note n="22">Peter Robinson, <title>The Transcription of Primary Sources Using SGML.</title> (Oxford: Office for Humanities Communications Publications, 1994), 7.</note> The three kinds of transcriptions offered here&#8212;facsimiles, diplomatic transcriptions, and e.text transcriptions&#8212;attempt to record and represent as many of the characteristics and dynamics of the original manuscripts as possible. Each, moreover, interprets the manuscripts from a different perspective: diplomatic transcriptions foreground the spatial dynamics of the manuscripts; e.text transcriptions foreground the temporal and linguistic dynamics of the manuscripts and the texts they carry; and facsimiles illuminate the interplay of both spatial and temporal dynamics in such a way as to impart to the "flat" image a kind of virtual "depth." Moreover, while the goal of the diplomatic and e.text transcriptions is the production of a legible text, the facsimiles emphasize the iconicity and essential otherness&#8212;what Edward Bullough called the "psychical distance"&#8212;of the manuscripts as well as our estrangement from the original scene of their composition.<note n="23">See Edward Bullough, "'Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and as an Aesthetic Principle," <title>British Journal of Psychology</title> 5 (1912): 87&#8211;117.</note>

                  The following measures were taken to produce high-quality images of Dickinson's manuscripts. The manuscripts were first photographed using Kodak 64T (color) film with tungsten lighting; the photographs were then converted to digitized images by means of photoCD; and, finally, the digitized images were sized, cropped, and color-corrected in such a way as to make Dickinson's handwriting clearly visible, but without distorting the appearance of the image, and placed against a black background. The images are scaled automatically to fit within the table specified in the design; if the original image is larger than the table, a link to a floating window offering a full-sized view of the image appears.<note n="24">Four different scans of each image in graduated sizes (3.4 x 5.1 at 300 dpi; .9 x .65 at 300 dpi; 1.7 x 2.6 at 300 dpi; 6.8 x 10.3 at 300 dpi) were made. In most cases the second to smallest was larger at screen resolution than the original, and, in general, that image was resized according to the ruler in the image and scaled in such a way that the ruler accompanying the image matched the ruler in Photoshop at 72 dpi, the standard screen resolution; if that size was smaller than the original, the next larger resolution was chosen and resized in the same manner. In this way re-sizing was always from larger to smaller, to preserve image quality.</note> In most cases the facsimiles reveal the precise contours and physical features&#8212;color tones, edges, folds, creases, watermarks and embosses, damaged sectors&#8212;of the manuscripts as well as changes in writing instrument and/or medium, gradations in the color of inks, variations in the thicknesses of leads, evidence of overwriting, scraping out, and erasure.

               In "All Writing Is Drawing: The Spatial Development of the Manuscript" Serge Tisseron remarks: "The current technological evolution is drawing noticeably closer to the conditions presiding over the manual creation of a manuscript. . . . Whereas the earliest typewriter technology estranged the user from the process of marking, the current developments tend towards a reconciliation with it."<note n="28">Serge Tisseron, "All Writing Is Drawing: The Spatial Development of the Manuscript," <title>Yale French Studies</title> 84 (1995): 30.</note> This edition uses print technology in combination with computer software designed to accommodate various aspects of scribal practice. Here the use of Macromedia FreeHand with Adobe Photoshop permitted us a partial escape from the logic of print, the logic of identity and fixity, and foregrounded the fundamentally critical nature of transcription. It also enabled us to register something of the manuscript's unique inflection.
               </p>
               <p>The method of transcription used here was developed in response to the particular demands of Dickinson's scriptural styles and interstitial page design.<note n="29">I initially made all of the transcriptions in PageMaker. Later, Patrick Bryant (Ph.D. candidate, Georgia State University) developed a far superior method of transcription using Macromedia FreeHand. I am deeply indebted to his explorations of the available technology and to his sensitivity to the demands of Dickinson's visual writing. His work on the transcriptions makes him one of the many collaborators on this project.</note> We began by calling a facsimile of the manuscript to be transcribed to the screen and tracing its contours to create a frame for the transcript. Next, we typed directly over the facsimile, reporting as precisely as possible the orthography, punctuation, line breaks, and spaces between letters and words. Though only three fonts were used to distinguish among three constantly recurring scriptural styles (rough-copy hand: LibreSansSerif; intermediate-copy hand: LibreSemiSans; fair-copy hand: LibreSemiSerif), font sizes were varied according to the size of the handwriting on the individual documents. The often dramatic magnification of letter forms characteristic of the fair-copy texts and the cramped hand of the rough-copy texts are thus partially represented in the diplomatic transcripts. The difficulty, at times impossibility, of distinguishing upper- and lowercase letters was a constant reminder to us that even the transcription of isolated characters is fundamentally interpretive. Here, however, we have singled out only Dickinson's "t" / "T"s for special treatment: in those instances where the crossbar appears to function as both part of the character and as a dash and/or underlining or emphasis, the "t" / "T" has usually been traced from the character on the facsimile. A strong case might well be made for treating Dickinson's initial "E"s / "e"s, "S"s / "s"s "O"s /"o"s, and "U"s / "u"s in the same manner. While we have compromised considerably in the representation of Dickinson's letter forms, we have been less compromising in the representation of her punctuation. Since Dickinson's angled dashes, flying quotation marks, dashes, periods, pointings, etc., are almost always expressive and open to interpretation (what constitutes a dash and what constitutes a period, for example, is particularly problematic and has often been decided arbitrarily in print editions), punctuation marks have been traced directly from the facsimiles. Similarly, strike-outs, underlinings, horizontal and vertical boundary lines, and other kinds of graphic "noise" have been traced from the facsimiles. Finally, in addition to recording the marks made on the manuscripts by Dickinson, the diplomatic transcriptions offer limited graphic equivalents of significant joining marks (e.g., the seams or instresses of an envelope), when they also constitute textual boundaries and extratextual materials (e.g., straight pins). Marks made on the manuscripts by copyists, editors, catalogers, and others appear when still discernible, in a grey italic font and in shadow; the authorship and significance of the markings is discussed in the commentary accompanying each document. </p>

               <p>When a diplomatic transcription is complete, it covers the image of the manuscript, concealing and even appearing to master it. Only, however, for an instant. For, at the precise moment when the image of the manuscript is obscured by the transcript, a kind of "kinetic occlusion" occurs: the transcript is "lifted off" and placed behind the facsimile, effecting a sudden restoration of the visible or the iconic over the legible. While the reader may access the transcript at any time by opening a "floating window" (and creating, if desired, an <hi rend="italics">en face</hi> edition), it always returns to its place as an uncanny revenant, a ghost text behind the facsimile.<note n="30">J.

                  <head type="subsub">Division of the Text Using SGML</head>
                  <p>In preparation for mark-up with SGML all of the materials in the archive were subjected to a rigorous formal analysis. This analysis indicated that the fragments and related texts should be encoded at three levels. Here the manuscript body (classified as a <hi rend="small caps">DIV0)</hi> is understood as the primary level from which all investigations, textual or critical, commence; the complete transcription of the physical document requires in turn that the encoder identify all of the possible texts (classified as <hi rend="small caps">DIV1s)</hi> nesting within that delimiting <hi rend="small caps">(DIV0)</hi> structure; and, finally, that smaller divisions (classified as <hi rend="small caps">EDs</hi> or, in the case of variants and traces, as <hi rend="small caps">SEGs)</hi> within discrete texts <hi rend="small caps">(DIV1s),</hi> including passages, stanzas, lines of verse and prose, phrases, isolated words, variants, and traces, are marked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">DIV0s:</hi> The decision to transcribe all of the texts on a given document runs counter to the conventional editorial treatment of Dickinson's late fragments. In Thomas H. Johnson's <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), for example, apparently discrete text fragments inscribed across a single document are removed from their material context, divided between two editorially determined categories ("To Unidentified Recipients," "Aphorisms"), and then printed alphabetically by first line in a numbered series that no longer reflects their relationship either to the document on which they were inscribed or to one another. Respecting the integrity of the physical document and carefully mapping its different zones (folds, seams, etc.) makes possible analyses of the relations between and among the texts each document carries. Moreover, since the document is often a metaphorical as well as an actual container for thoughts&#8212;an envelope shaped like a bird carries a text about flight, its seal becomes the space for a meditation on secrecy, the two sides of a manuscript are inscribed with rhyming texts, a torn edge corresponds to a textual verge, etc.&#8212;maintaining the integrity of the physical document facilitates further investigation into the relationship between Dickinson's medium and her messages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">DIV1s:</hi> The analysis of Dickinson's late manuscripts brings to light a considerable number of texts and text types. The need to account for all of the possible texts that emerge during the transcription of a given document has been partially accommodated by the use of the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> element. Each <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> identifies an apparently discrete text, which is in turn assigned a "type." The assignation of "types" to Dickinson's manuscripts is problematic for several reasons, and the following list of types&#8212;fragment(s), extrageneric; message-fragment; poem; poem, trial beginning; poem-letter; letter; letter-poem; letter, with poem(s) embedded; letter, with poem(s) enclosed; letter, with poem(s) embedded and enclosed; address; practice signatures; pen tests; recipe and/or ephemera&#8212;should be treated as a "working list," rather than an exhaustive or definitive list for several reasons. Many of the fragments are too brief to be classified definitively as "prose" or "verse," while others continually shift between prose and verse. The assumption frequently made by textual editors that text types can be determined retrospectively&#8212;a text fragment that is incorporated into a poem is a "verse fragment," while a text fragment incorporated into a letter is a "prose fragment"&#8212;is also not tenable, first because it fails to account for the essential autonomy of the fragment and its resistance to classification, and second because it fails to recognize that the author's intentions toward a fragment may be multiple. Here fragments are typed as "extrageneric" except in instances where a fragment is clearly a message to a specific (and usually identifiable) addressee and cannot also be considered a freestanding, autonomous text. Notes regarding type, state (rough-copy draft, intermediate-copy draft, fair-copy draft), media (pencil, ink), and hand (rough, intermediate, fair) are provided at the level of the text <hi rend="small caps">(DIV1),</hi> rather than at the level of the document <hi rend="small caps">(DIV0).</hi> Text-specific notes about type, state, media, and hand are especially important given Dickinson's practice of inscribing multiple texts in different states, media, and hands on a single document. </p>
                  <p>Information concerning the original location of the documents is provided at the level of the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1.</hi> Manuscripts sent by Dickinson outside of her personal archive are marked "mailed"; unmarked manuscripts may be assumed to have remained among Dickinson's own papers. Similarly, manuscripts bound into volumes are marked "bound"; unmarked manuscripts may be assumed to be loose sheets or fragments.</p>
                  <p>The determinations of "state" made here are open to revision. The determinations of "state" made here are open to revision. The terms "rough-copy," "intermediate-copy," and "fair-copy" are not ideal terms with which to describe documents of an essentially private nature. In order to distinguish a fair-copy sent out of Dickinson's personal archive from a fair-copy housed within her personal archive I have added the word "draft" to the latter category. The vast majority of the fragments appear to be rough-copy drafts. In only a few special cases&#8212;when a fragment appears to have progressed from a rough-copy to an intermediate-copy draft, or when a fragment has been excerpted from a fair-copy draft, for instance&#8212;have I offered a more refined hypothesis about the state of the fragment at the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> level. </p>
                  <p>Even more fundamentally than the assignation of text types, the division of a series of lines inscribed across a single document into discrete texts is a matter of interpretation: the assumption that it is possible to mark definitively the line where one text-fragment ends and another begins is called into question by the very different printed configurations of the fragments. Here, while <hi rend="small caps">DIV1s</hi> mark what appear to be boundaries or transitions between and among texts on a given document, these boundaries are not absolute, and the "uncertain fault line of intertextuality" remains visible.<note n="31">Steven Jones, "Material Intertextuality: The Case of Shelley's Rough-Draft Notebooks," <title>Text: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Textual Studies</title> 8 (1995): 242.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">EDs:</hi> The textual field is continuously divisible into smaller and smaller parts, greater and greater detail. The need to account for all of the possible internal textual divisions has been accommodated by the use of the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element. In verse texts, the stanza or verse line has generally been understood to be the base structural unit. Dickinson's writings, however, challenge the ways in which we understand and mark internal textual divisions. Her commitment to metrical experimentation, particularly her breaking (out) of traditional meters, often leads to considerable uncertainty about what constitutes a line of verse. The noncorrespondence in her poems, moreover, between "metrically complete" lines and physical line breaks, many of which appear to be intentional, further problematizes the choice of the base structural unit. Rather than dividing verse texts into verse lines, I have divided them into stanzas; in verse texts without clear stanza divisions, the text remains undivided and the notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element reads simply: "lines, verse." The <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element has also been used to mark "variant clusters," the strings of variant or additional word choices often appearing below the body proper of the poem.</p>
                  <p>In prose texts the paragraph or, in certain instances, the sentence, has generally been understood as the base structural unit. Here, too, however, this base structural unit is problematic. In the first place, Dickinson did not use paragraphs in a conventional way: in her rough-copy prose texts there is rarely any division of lines into paragraphs; in her fair-copy prose texts there is often evidence of division, but the divisions are not always clear both because Dickinson did not in general indent the opening line of a "paragraph" and also because while she often marked shifts of thought/subject by leaving several blank spaces at the end of a line, many shifts remain unmarked because they coincide with the far edge of the page. Second, Dickinson's idiosyncratic punctuation, especially her dashes, often makes it difficult even to say where a given sentence concludes. Rather than dividing prose texts into sentences and paragraphs, I have chosen to divide them into "passages," an inclusive term designating "phrases," "sentences," and "paragraphs." In those prose texts where there is no clear division of text into smaller units&#8212;a common situation in the rough-copy prose drafts&#8212;the notation in <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element reads simply: "lines, prose." Finally, in instances in which the text shifts between verse and prose, as many of Dickinson's letters do, the locations of the shifts are recorded with a notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element. In addition to dividing, wherever possible, Dickinson's letters into passages, <hi rend="small caps">EDs</hi> also delimit the different spaces or levels of a letter: the date (when added by Dickinson), the salutation, the closing, the signature, and any postscripts following the body of the letter.</p>
                  <p>The fragments, almost all of which are interpreted as generically undecidable, are rarely meaningfully divided below the <hi rend="small caps">DIV1</hi> level; the notation in the <hi rend="small caps">ED</hi> element for fragments reads simply: "lines."</p>
                  <p>The question of how best to divide Dickinson's poems, letters, and fragments in order to reveal their linguistic and physical structures has not been satisfactorily resolved and is a matter for continued scholarly discussion and debate. The potential of SGML to represent different structures within a single text will almost certainly offer interesting alternatives to the present schema. </p>

                     <hi rend="small caps">GRAPHIC BOUNDARIES:</hi> In general, boundary lines drawn by Dickinson on the manuscripts are registered with the <hi rend="small caps">milestone</hi> element; the type of boundary line&#8212;horizontal line, vertical line, brackets, open parentheses&#8212;is indicated with the <hi rend="small caps">UNIT</hi> attribute. In a few instances (e.g., A 514), where use of the <hi rend="small caps">milestone</hi> element would be confusing or repetitive, a graphic boundary has been recorded in the <hi rend="small caps">ADD</hi> element.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">SPACES:</hi> Spaces appearing in the manuscripts to indicate stanza breaks, breaks between the salutation or signature of a letter or message and the body of the letter or message, and spaces in the interior of the text that appear to divide it into sections are indicated with the <hi rend="small caps">SPACE</hi> element. Although the organization of the page as a series of words and spaces is clearly part of rather than supplementary to the content of Dickinson's compositions, local spaces between letters and words are not noted in the SGML encoding; readers should consult the facsimiles and diplomatic transcripts to gain a fuller sense of Dickinson's interstitial page design.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">ORIENTATION:</hi> All changes in the orientation of the paper are indicated with the <hi rend="small caps">SEG=ORIENT</hi> element; the direction and degree of the rotation is noted with the <hi rend="small caps">REND</hi> attribute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="small caps">PAGE BREAKS:</hi> All page breaks are marked with the <hi rend="small caps">PB</hi> element; the type of break&#8212;recto to verso; first leaf to second leaf, etc.&#8212;is indicated with the <hi rend="small caps">REND</hi> attribute. I have used the term "reverse" rather than "verso" in cases where the lack of bibliographically distinguishing traits on the paper would make the use of "verso" inaccurate.</p>
                  <p>
                        <hi rend="small caps">VARIANTS:</hi> Two methods have been used to identify and link textual variants. In simple cases&#8212;e.g., when Dickinson substituted one word or phrase for another through deletion and addition, or when she added, without deleting, an alternate word choice&#8212;I have used the <hi rend="small caps">ADD</hi> element in combination with the <hi rend="small caps">APP/RDG</hi> elements and the <hi rend="small caps">ID/CORRESP</hi> attributes to express the relationship between variant readings. In more complex cases&#8212;e.g., when Dickinson recorded more than a single variant for a word, a line, a phrase, or a passage, or when variants are separated from each other by a span of text&#8212;I have used the <hi rend="small caps">SEG=VAR</hi> (and <hi rend="small caps">SEG=SUBVAR)</hi> element with the <hi rend="small caps">ID/CORRESP</hi> attributes to express the relationships among variant readings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                          <hi rend="small caps">TRACES:</hi> Traces&#8212;that is, those lines, phrases, or passages in Dickinson's fragments that appear in other texts&#8212;are identified with the <hi rend="small caps">SEG=TRACE</hi> element; the texts in which they reappear (often altered) are identified with the <hi rend="small caps">ID/CORRESP</hi> attributes.
                  </p>
                  <p>In theory it is possible to match the "limitless repertoire of scribal signs in a manuscript . . . [with the] limitless repertoire of computer signs," and, since many of Dickinson's letter forms appear to be interpretive rather than simply mechanical, future editors may decide to distinguish among different forms of "T"/ "t," "O"/ "o," "U"/ "u," "E"/ "e," "S"/ "s," etc.<note n="32">Peter Robinson, <title>The Transcription of Primary Textual Sources Using SGML.</title> (Oxford: Office for Humanities Communications Publications, 1994), 7.</note> The practical application of this radical approach to the representation of individual characters, however, still requires some standardization: in order to make the text tractable for computer processing, the potentially limitless signs in the primary text must be translated into a clearly defined character set that the computer can store, display, sort, and search. Faced with the choice of creating a new set of standardized characters for particular letter forms or of simply using an existing set, I chose the latter option and in the e.text transcriptions followed standard typesetting conventions with regard to letter forms, spacing, and punctuation.</p>

                  <head type="subsub">The Representation of Temporal Dynamics Using SGML</head>
                  <p>Inscription is the movement of the hand across space and through time. While the diplomatic transcriptions record the spatial dynamics of the manuscripts, the syntax of the electronic transcriptions reflects, wherever discernible, the temporal dynamics of the compositional process: in the e.text transcriptions I have tried to record the sequence in which a series of words, lines, and marks were made on paper. While at times a very clear record of the successive moments of composition&#8212;the hand in the present tense of writing&#8212;emerges, at other times no clear record of these moments can be discerned, and the representation of temporal dynamics involves an act of speculative reconstruction. Dickinson's introduction of variants at different moments of the compositional process further complicates the representation of temporal dynamics. In general, it appears that Dickinson added interlineated words during the initial phase of composition and added words and lines composed sideways along the edges of the manuscript or traversing the body of the text in later, revisionary phases. Here variant readings appearing above and below the text appear immediately after the words or passages to which they refer, followed by variant readings composed in the left and right edges of the text and variant readings traversing the center of the text; variant readings inscribed below the body of the text are not keyed into the body of the text, but follow it, in keeping with both the temporal and spatial order of composition. When more than one line or passage has been added in the margins of the paper, I have transcribed the variant lines in the order in which the lines to which they refer appear in the body of the text, though of course there is nothing to prove that Dickinson always revised by reading from the beginning of the text. In instances where the representation of a manuscript's temporal dynamics conflicts with the representation of its spatial dynamics, the temporal and/or linguistic dynamics have been privileged in the e.text transcription; in these cases a note has been added to clarify the spatial dynamics that have been obscured. Finally, it should be noted that SGML encoding cannot reveal the absolute temporality of composition Dickinson's texts, to which returned not only moments but sometimes days and even years after first abandoning. </p>

                  <head type="subsub">E.Text Views</head>
                  <p>The reader may select from among four different views of an e.text transcription of a document: a view revealing the complete SGML encoding of the document; a reading view of the document in which much though not all of the SGML encoding is translated graphically; a view of the variant readings in the text that organizes them in relationally meaningful ways; and a view of the traces in the fragment text, with links to the other texts containing the trace(s).</p>
                  <p>The SGML-encoded view of the documents will be of interest primarily to other encoders working on electronic editions. Yet it should also be of interest to scholars and editors, for the encoding schema is part of the editorial apparatus of the archive, and it offers a comprehensive&#8212;if also an especially deeply embedded&#8212;record of the editorial principles governing the presentation of individual documents in the archive as well as the principles binding them together. A thorough, objective analysis of the encoding of individual documents will reveal where these editorial principles work and where they break down in a way that a general textual introduction outlining those principles cannot hope to reveal.</p>
                  <p id="IRS600">
                    The reading view of the documents clarifies the temporal dynamics of their composition. In this view the SGML encoding is translated both symbolically and graphically. Inserted text is indicated with arrows (supralinear additions are indicated using up and down arrows; infralinear additions are indicated using down and up arrows; additions in the margins are indicated using right and left arrows). Local deletions (canceled letters, words, and passages) are indicated graphically as strike-outs; cancelations of entire texts or manuscript faces are indicated symbolically using brackets ("[]"). Editorially supplied text is enclosed in brackets ("{}"). Line breaks, underlining, and indentation are indicated graphically. Other information, including information about text types, internal textual divisions, milestones, gaps, and page breaks, is expressed verbally and appears in a shadow font in the transcription.
                  </p>
                  <p>The third and fourth options offer viewers more focused views of the documents. The third view isolates the variants in a given text and enables the reader to see the relations (substantive, temporal) among them at a glance. The fourth view isolates the trace(s) in a given document and gives the reader the option of viewing linked traces in other documents.</p>
                  <p>Finally, in addition to the four views of a given document, readers may choose to view "Document Constellations" <hi rend="small caps">(LINKGRPS).</hi> The document constellations take as their points of departure Dickinson's trace and variant fragments and show the texts to which they are related, thus making it possible for readers to explore the various possible genetic relationships among the surviving witnesses and to consider different versions of the compositional history of a constellation of related texts.<note n="32a">
                        <hi rend="small caps">LINKS</hi> within <hi rend="small caps">LINKGRPS</hi> are arranged alphabetically, and thus the order of links in a given chain does not necessarily represent the order of the composition of the witnesses. Readers are free to create their own stemmata for document constellations from the available textual evidence.</note> It should be noted that document constellations exhibit a marked centrifugal tendency that has not been fully represented here; that is, the more closely one considers the relations among documents, the more relations one discovers. Here, while the relations between Dickinson's fragments and the "target" documents in which they reappear in part or entire as traces are specified, the relations between the "target" documents in the constellations and other documents in Dickinson's oeuvre have not been specified unless they are also directly related to the fragments. In the future the document constellations given here may be extended to represent the complex relations among all of the documents&#8212;fragments <hi rend="italics">and</hi> "target" texts&#8212;in a given constellation and between these documents and all of the documents that make up Dickinson's oeuvre</p>

               <p>More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold. . . . It is an 'undefined zone' between the inside and the outside, a zone without any hard or fast boundary on either the inward side (turned toward the text) or the outward side (turned towards the world's discourse about the text), an edge, or, as Philippe Lejeune put it, 'a fringe of the printed text. . . .' Indeed, this fringe, always the conveyor of a commentary that is authorial [editorial] or more or less legitimated by the author [editor], constitutes a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but of a transaction: a privileged place of a pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that . . . is at the service of a better reception of the text and a more pertinent reading of it (more pertinent, of course, in the eyes of the author [editor] and his allies).  &#8212;G&#233;rard Genette</p>

            <p>In <title>Radical Scatters</title> two kinds of paratexts mediate the reader's relationship with the archive's raw materials: paratexts functioning as entryways into and different modes of orientation within the archive ("Contents," "Indices," "Site Map," "Library of Search Paths," "Hand Library," "User's Guide") and paratexts offering critical environments for the interpretation of Dickinson's fragments and related texts ("'Most Arrows,'" "The Interpretation of Radical Scatters," "Scatters: Bibliography").

            <div3 type="subsection">
               <head type="subhead">Fragments</head>
               <p>Every fragment in the archive is accompanied by a fivefold notation comprising: a physical description of the document on which it is inscribed; a note identifying the collection in which the document is currently housed; information on the transmission history of the document; information on the publication history of the document; and editorial and critical commentaries on the document, the text(s) it carries, and the other documents and/or texts in the archive to which it is linked.</p>
               <p>The physical description of each document carrying a fragment includes the following information: the document's catalog or library accession number (or, in the case of privately owned manuscripts, the name of its current owner); its type; its approximate date of composition; the number and arrangement of its leaves; the type of paper on which it is inscribed; the dimensions of the leaves or partial leaves of the document; the condition of the document's edges; the folding patterns on the document; and the medium of composition.</p>
               <p>Creating viable and defensible dates for Dickinson's late writings, especially her fragments, is challenging, and perhaps even impossible in cases where there is no corroborating contextual or paper evidence. The evidence of handwriting, though useful for determining the general period of Dickinson's career ("early," "middle," "late") to which a text belongs, is of less use for determining the exact year of composition&#8212;especially for Dickinson's late compositions. The difficulty of assigning composition dates on the basis of handwriting is particularly acute in the case of Dickinson's late rough-copy drafts, where handwriting evidence is often contradictory. Although I may be accused of excessive caution, I do not assign Dickinson's fragments to specific years, but only to the late period of her writing career, c. 1870&#8211;1886. I have assigned fragments to this date-range even in cases in which fragments reappear in other documents that can be assigned more precise composition dates because the fragment-traces were not <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> composed at the same time as the texts in which they appear. The date-range for the fragments may of course be narrowed when paper evidence is present&#8212;that is, we may assume that a text inscribed on a piece of <hi rend="small caps">WESTON'S LINEN 1876</hi> was not composed before 1876. The date-ranges to which I have assigned fragments (and related texts) are recorded in the "Code Summaries" accompanying the document; in the entry for "Date" in the "Physical Description" heading for each fragment I have recorded, in brackets, the dates assigned to the fragment by Thomas H. Johnson in <title><ref target="abbr.poem1955" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1955) and/or <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), and by R. W. Franklin in <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998). R. W. Franklin dated documents, as opposed to texts, and thus each document is, generally, assigned a single composition date. Thomas H. Johnson seems to have dated texts rather than documents, and, at times, he assigned different composition dates to discrete texts inscribed on a single document.  Thomas Johnson did not have all of Dickinson's manuscripts at his disposal during his editing of her writings. A number of fragments which he might have included in the notes to the poems or letters to which they have links&#8212;had he had access to all of the documents at once&#8212;he placed instead among the "Prose Fragments" (see <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> [1958]), all of which Johnson imagined belonged to the last decade of Dickinson's life. In cases where Johnson cross-references a fragment placed in "Prose Fragments" with another, more precisely dated text, I have given both dates (["about 1873 or last decade"]) assigned by him.</p>
               <p>With very few exceptions, the fragments remained among Dickinson's papers until after her death. Jay Leyda, who catalogued the manuscripts of the fragments, reported, whenever possible, the dates of the fragments' removal from Dickinson's papers. Leyda was almost certainly relying on information about transmission provided by Millicent Todd Bingham. My notes on the transmission histories of the fragments follow Leyda's.<note n="33">Jay Leyda's notes, many of which are recorded on the cover sheets accompanying the copies of Dickinson's manuscripts in the Amherst College Library, are an invaluable source of information to the researcher working on Dickinson's late fragments. I am greatly indebted to his pioneering work with these documents.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Publication histories report the publication histories of all of the texts inscribed on a given document. In addition to reporting the first published source of each of the texts on a given document, publication histories report significant subsequent publications of the texts&#8212;that is, printings of texts based on a new analysis of the original documents, rather than on the analysis of earlier printed editions. The following editions, based on an analysis of Dickinson's manuscripts, have been cited: <title>Poems by Emily Dickinson</title> (1890, 1891, 1896); <title>Letters of Emily Dickinson</title> (1894); <title>The Single Hound</title> (1914); <title>Further Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1929); <title><ref target="abbr.let1931" rend="bibl">Letters of Emily Dickenson</ref></title> (1931) (*Note: Only texts not previously printed in <title>Letters</title> [1894] are cited); <title>Emily Dickinson Face to Face</title> (1932); <title>Unpublished Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1935); <title>Bolts of Melody</title> (1945); <title>Emily Dickinson's Letters to Dr. and Mrs. Josiah Gilbert Holland</title> (1951); <title>Emily Dickinson: A Revelation</title> (1954); <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1955); <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters of Emily Dickerson</ref></title> (1958); <title>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</title> (1981); <title>The Master Letters of Emily Dickinson</title> (1986); <title>Emily Dickinson's Open Folios: Scenes of Reading, Surfaces of Writing</title> (1995); <title>Open Me Carefully: Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington Dickinson</title> (1998); and <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1998). The September 1955 issue of the <title>New England Quarterly</title> is the first printed source of many of Emily Dickinson's fragments; it is cited throughout. Not cited, unless required by special circumstances, are <title>The Life and Letters of Emily Dickinson</title> (1924); <title>The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1924); <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1930); <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1937); <title>The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1960); <title>Final Harvest</title> (1962); and <title>New Poems of Emily Dickinson</title> (1993). </p>
               <p>It is important to note that the publication histories report the publication history only of the <hi rend="italics">version</hi> of text found on the document featured in the electronic archive; they do not report the publication histories of all versions of the text, or of an "ideal" text. The comparison of various kinds of publication histories&#8212;e.g., the publication history of a specific version of a text, the publication history of all the versions of a text, the publication histories of all the texts on a given document, the publication histories of constellations of texts&#8212;will be possible in the future when an electronic archive of Dickinson's complete writings becomes available. All printed versions of Dickinson's handwritten texts, including my own, alter their dynamics. Although specific alterations of lineation, punctuation, and capitalization in the printed versions of her texts are not discussed in the notes, readers should be aware that such alterations occur.<note n="34">The Emily Dickinson Editing Collective (Coordinator: Martha Nell Smith, University of Maryland; Key Editors: Martha Nell Smith; Ellen Louise Hart, University of California, Santa Cruz; Marta Werner, Georgia State University) is currently developing plans for a critical hypermedia archive of Dickinson's complete writings. Working with the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia and the Humanities Text Initiative at the University of Michigan, the collective is committed to "re-editing [Dickinson's] writings in production performances that digitize images of her manuscripts and provide diplomatic transcriptions and notes in searchable form, thereby enabling new kinds of critical inquiry previously unimaginable within the constraints of the book" (qtd. in an unpublished grant application [1997]). The hypermedia archive also plans to make available all of the printed versions of Dickinson's writings. </note>

                Two kinds of notes accompany the fragments: explanatory notes call attention to details not adequately represented in the facsimiles and transcripts, raise questions about the material boundaries and linguistic shifts/breaks within the documents, identify significant allusions, offer readings of problematic passages, and discuss marks made on the manuscripts by editors and copyists; and relational notes provide links to images and transcripts of the documents in the archive and to "Document Constellations" <hi rend="small caps">(LINKGRPS),</hi> as well as to the "Library of Search Paths" and various other editorial paratexts. Identifying editorial marks made on the manuscripts continues to be an especially challenging task. R. W. Franklin, Martha Nell Smith, and Ellen Hart examined many manuscripts featuring handwriting I could not positively identify, and I am much indebted to their expertise; responsibility for any misidentifications of handwriting is, however, entirely my own.<note n="35">Three sources provide valuable information about the editorial marks made on the documents. R. W. Franklin's introduction to <title>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</title> offers a useful summary of the editorial marks found on the poems in the fascicles and the sets; Millicent Todd Bingham's unpublished <hi rend="small caps">"GUIDE</hi> to the Use of the Microfilm of <hi rend="small caps">THE EMILY DICKINSON MANUSCRIPTS"</hi> presented by Millicent Todd Bingham to Amherst College, 1956&#8211;1957, offers brief but useful notes regarding the editorial marks inscribed on both bound and loose poems; and, finally, Jay Leyda's  notes at Amherst College record the numbers of the envelopes containing manuscript volumes or individual poems.</note>

As Johnson himself admitted, the dates assigned to many of Dickinson's poems and letters are open to revision; indeed, the fragments often challenge the 1955 variorum's dating schema in interesting ways.<note n="36">In "Notes on the Present Text" (in <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson,</title> 3 vols. [Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1955]) Thomas H.

               <p>The poems, letters, and other texts linked to the fragments are divided among seven libraries and one private collection.

In many cases the transmission histories of these documents, especially those that were scattered beyond Dickinson's personal papers, are unclear; they are reported when known. By identifying in the physical descriptions those poems, letters, and other writings related to the fragments discovered among Dickinson's papers, as well as those poems, letters, and other writings that passed out of Dickinson's hands, the archive offers some basic information about her filing system.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>In his recent book <title>Open Sky,</title> Paul Virilio calls our attention to the concept of trajectivity: "It seems we are still incapable of seriously entertaining this <hi rend="italics">question of the path,</hi> except in the realms of mechanics, ballistics or astronomy. Objectivity, subjectivity, certainly, but never <hi rend="italics">trajectivity."</hi>
               <note n="37">Paul Virilio, <title>Open Sky,</title> translated by Julie Rose (London: Verso, 1997), 24.</note> The hypertext archive offers a new site for an exploration of trajectivity. Since the archive does not, properly speaking, have an "end" (it does, despite what I may sometimes seem to be saying, have a limit) the reader does not direct him- or herself toward its final destination, but, instead, immediately takes up the <hi rend="italics">question of the path.</hi> The power of the archive is, then, the power to induce a departure.</p>
            <p>Consider the reader's position immediately after opening the archive of Dickinson's late fragments and clicking on the introductory image. From the <hi rend="small caps">CONTENTS</hi> screen three general options are presented: readers may enter any of the various critical environments of the archive to find information about its organizing principles and constraints; they may access the primary materials of the archive directly by selecting a document listed in any one of the archive's indices; or, they may browse in the archive's libraries. Only the first choice leads rather quickly to a dead end, requiring readers to return to the <hi rend="small caps">CONTENTS</hi> screen&#8212;or the <hi rend="small caps">SITE MAP</hi>&#8212;and choose one of the other two points of entry.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, readers choose to enter <title>Radical Scatters</title> by selecting a document from one of the archive's indices or by selecting a code or hand from one of the archive's libraries, the "question of the path" immediately opens before them. At times the close study of elements and attributes within a given document will delimit the trajectory of an exploration. At other times the exploration of document constellations, and especially the relations among the fragments and the texts in which they reappear, creates a dialectic process leading readers toward the discovery of new patterns. The presentation of a fragment both as an intertext, a trace "within" various texts&#8212;poems, letters, etc.&#8212;and as numerically distinct from the other texts in the constellation encourages us to respond to both the fragment and the texts in which it appears quite differently than a hierarchical display in which fragments appear only as footnotes to finished texts: while the conventional display implies that we will find the fragment(s) interesting because we have found the "finished" poem or letter of value, the dehierarchized display illuminates both fragments and "target" texts as at once linked and freestanding documents. And, finally, readers may act as "shifters," cutting their way across the various levels of the archive by following a single code or a combination of codes (that is, documents with canceled faces; documents written in ink; documents written on envelope fragments, etc.). Always, theories of navigation are subject to change during the course of a research session as a result of unforeseen discoveries or new questions. </p>
            <p>In general, the best readers of Dickinson's fragments do not read linearly but recursively, finding, often by losing, their different ways through the archive. The number of codes, types, searchable fields, and links is finite and editorially determined; the number of paths that can be traced through the materials, however, is almost limitless&#8212;or, rather, limited only by the reader's willingness to track individual codes, attributes, and elements and to collate search results, or by his or her imagination of combinatory possibilities. The paths traced by the reader through the electronic archive are the very tales, "traveler's tales," that in <title>Open Sky</title> Virilio fears will be lost, along with "the possibility of some kind of interpretation," on the information superhighway.<note n="38">Virilio, <title>Open Sky,</title> 25.</note> To be sure, there are risks. As Mireille Rosello writes, since the "screener's navigation . . . [is] both read and written at the same time . . . meaning . . . [becomes] fragile, easily destroyed, [almost] impossible to record."<note n="39">Mireille Rosello, "The Screener's Maps: Michel de Certeau's 'Wandersm&#235;nner' and Paul Auster's Hypertextual Detective." In <title>Hyper/Text/Theory,</title> edited by George P. Landow (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994), 148. I have added the bracketed word "almost," since a number of experimental interfaces such as "Information Visualizer" (XeroxPARC) and "Abulafia" seem to promise the possibility of virtual memory; for further information, see Gunnar Liest&#248;l's essay "Wittgenstein, Genette, and the Reader's Narrative in Hypertext," in <title>Hyper/Text/Theory, 87&#8211;120.</title></note> Yet, however fragile, illegible, or quickly erased these virtual itineraries (the inscription of which begins the moment the reader&#8212;the screener&#8212;enters the archive and ends only arbitrarily when he or she exits) may be, they are also new signifying (critical, creative) narratives that we cannot ignore and that require a new theory&#8212;a new method&#8212;of (speed) <hi rend="italics">readingwriting</hi> (screening).</p>

            <p>I discovered the title of this archive, <title>Radical Scatters,</title> in a book on the migratory patterns of birds.<note n="40">G. V. T. Matthews, <title>Bird Navigation</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1968), 49.</note> In order to determine whether or not certain birds possess homing instincts, a person known as a "liberator" throws several of them up into the air one at a time, each time facing in a different direction. The birds are then watched out of sight, and the points at which they disappear from view are recorded. When a significant number of vanishing points has been noted, a chart called a "scatter diagram" is drawn up for study. At times, for reasons that are not yet fully understood, some birds on the outward course drift widely across the migration axis. These drifts, called "radical scatters," both solicit and resist definitive interpretation. Dickinson's late fragments are the textual equivalents of the scattered migrants. Freed from the forty bound manuscript volumes, the accumulated libraries of her poetic production, they fly outside the codex book and to the lyric's many ends. No editor can hope to bring about their harmonious synthesis. Rather, they require an alternative model of presentation, a new paradigm based, perhaps, on what Ira Livingston calls a "chaology of knowledge."<note n="41">Ira Livingston, <title>Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity</title> (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1997), vii.</note> Instead of classifying the fragments according to conventional bibliographical and generic codes we need to find ways of not naming them as they flash by; instead of binding them into chronological order in a codex book, we need to find ways of launching them into circulation again and again in the hopes of illuminating the tensions and freedoms at the heart of Dickinson's late work. </p>

            <p>Viewers will first open <title>Radical Scatters</title> in a browser&#8212;Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are suggested for browsing the archive, although other browser software should work as well&#8212;and the introductory image will be loaded. When viewers click on the introductory image, or the <hi rend="small caps">CONTENTS</hi> button below it, the "Contents Screen" will appear in a new window without the browser's built-in buttons or menus. From the "Contents Screen," viewers have three general options: they may access the primary materials of the archive directly through one of the archive's indices; they may browse in either the "Library of Search Paths" or in the "Hand Library"; or they may enter any of the various critical environments of the archive. The "Site Map" offers a visual overview of the structure of the archive; thus, viewers may also reposition&#8212;or simply reorient&#8212;themselves at any place in the archive by invoking the "Site Map" and choosing a new location. From each of the second-level screens (see "Site Map"), a manuscript display page is only one link away. From any manuscript display page, alternate displays of the document are only a link away. Links between the archive's raw materials and the various paratexts enable viewers who choose to enter the archive directly to access additional information about a document or text and to perform any number of analytic operations without closing the document selected for study. Navigation within the archive relies on Javascript, a standard feature of most browser software. Viewers who have disabled Javascript will need to enable it in the "browser's preferences" in order to continue beyond the introductory screen.</p>

            <head type="subhead">Library of Search Paths</head>
            <p>The "Library of Search Paths" offers an extensive list of possible search paths. From the "Library of Search Paths" viewers may search across the archive for documents falling within certain generic categories (fragment, poem, letter, etc.); for documents falling within certain composition dates (early, middle, late); for documents belonging to particular file types (bound documents, unbound documents, mailed documents); for documents composed on various paper types; for documents composed in different kinds of media (pencil, ink); for documents composed in different hands (rough, fair, intermediate); for documents evidencing specific material characteristics (torn edges, scissored edges, etc.); for documents evidencing specific scribal practices (additions, interlineations, cancelations, cross-writing, etc.); for documents marked by editors; and for documents housed in specific collections. </p>
            <p>
            The system allows full text searching of all Dickinson's texts as well as of the editorially supplied critical commentaries. Simple, boolean, and proximity searches are all supported. The "Simple Search" option may be used to search for all occurrences of single words or phrases in the archive; the "Boolean Search" option and the "Proximity Search" option may be used to search for two or more words or phrases in conjunction with one another. 
            </p>
            <p>Simple Searches. The simple search option should be used when you want to look for every occurrence of a word or phrase in the archive. To search, first enter a word or phrase, then hit the enter or return key. The search returns a list of places where the word or phrase appears in the archive.  <figure entity="simple">

               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Boolean Searches. The boolean search option should be used when you want to combine search terms.  You can join the terms with "and," "or," and "not."  The default choice is  "and." To broaden a search, use  "or"; to narrow a search, use "not." <figure entity="boolean">
                  <figDesc>focus 3: Boolean Search</figDesc>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Proximity Searches. The proximity search option should be used when you want to look for the co-occurrence of search terms. You can search for several words or phrases in conjunction with one another; you can search for words or phrases in different relations to one another (for example, words or phrases within a single  text, or within a constellation of texts); and you can search for words and phrases within a designated number of words or characters of each other. <figure entity="proximity">

            <p>Code, Element, and Attribute Searches. You may search for recurring codes, elements, and attributes by applying the same principles used for searching text (see above). The simple search option should be used when you want to look for every occurrence of a single code, attribute, or element  in the archive. The boolean search option should be used when you want to search for a combination of codes and/or elements and attributes. The proximity search option should be used when you want to look for the co-occurrence of codes, attributes, and/or elements. <figure entity="code">

               <title>Radical Scatters</title> offers three different representations of the archive's core materials: graphic files containing high-quality facsimiles of the fragments and related texts; graphic files containing diplomatic transcriptions; and files containing SGML-marked e.texts of the fragments and related texts. The first image of a document summoned to the screen will either be a facsimile of the original manuscript (scaled to fit in the frame of the screen) or an electronic transcript of the "Reading View" of the text (see the "Directory of Indices" to determine which indices will summon facsimiles to the screen and which indices will summon reading texts to the screen). <hi rend="small caps">NEXT / BACK</hi> buttons, located at the bottom of each view, take viewers forward or backward through the pages of a given document. Regardless of what view is initially selected, once the facsimile image or electronic transcript of the document is open viewers may choose from among four "Alternate Views" of the document: a facsimile of the original manuscript ("MSS Facsimile"); a diplomatic transcription of the document ("Transcript"); an electronic transcript of the text displaying the full SGML encoding of the document ("SGML View"); and an electronic transcript of the text that translates most aspects of the encoding into a more readable form ("Reading View"). An arrow appears beside the view selected by the viewer. In each instance, the chosen view will open in a new window on top of the current window. Viewers will need to spend some time learning how best to manipulate and arrange the windows. Keep in mind that you can always tell what windows are open by looking at the icons (on the taskbar at the bottom of your screen in Windows 95, for example); clicking on one of those icons will bring its window to the top. Windows can also be moved from one place to another on the screen and resized. For detailed instructions on manipulating multiple windows, consult the Help documentation for your operating system.</p>

            <p>April 16, 1862: I took [Emily Dickinson's letter of the previous day] from the post office in Worcester, Mass., where I was then living. It was postmarked "Amherst," and it was in a handwriting so peculiar that it seemed as if the writer might have taken her first lessons by studying the famous fossil bird-tracks in the museum of that college town.  &#8212;Thomas Wentworth Higginson</p>

            <p>In the single daguerreotype of Dickinson, probably taken at Mount Holyoke Academy when she was just seventeen, the aptitude of her long and tapered hands&#8212;there paralyzed around a stock bunch of dried flowers given to sitters who appeared nervous&#8212;remains hidden. Instead, their true progress is inscribed on the pages of her manuscripts, on which Dickinson makes manifest the traces of the writing process as well as the intimate relationship in her artistic process between conception and execution&#8212;or, more simply, the significance of touch to writing . . . </p>
            <p>Several narratives&#8212;biographical, artistic, cultural&#8212;have emerged to account for the evolution of Dickinson's handwriting styles. Some early scholars suggested that changes in Dickinson's handwriting may have corresponded to changes in her vision; others speculated that significant changes in her handwriting paralleled shifts in Dickinson's psychic equilibrium. More recent scholars have focused on the ways in which Dickinson's handwriting inscribes her resistance to the economy of mechanical reproduction&#8212;especially the printing process but also the practice of copying that has as its goal the erasure of the traces of the writing process.<note n="42">For general guides to Emily Dickinson's handwriting, see especially Theodora Ward, "Characteristics of the Handwriting," in <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson,</title> 3 vols., edited by Thomas H. Johnson (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1955). For medical explanations of changes in Dickinson's vision that may have affected her handwriting, see, for example, Richard B.

Unwilling to make herself over in the mirror image of the printing press, or to deny the "organic relationship between [herself] and [her] literary work," Dickinson insisted on the sensual scripting of the writing self reaching toward the antipodes of autonomism.<note n="45">Gillian Brown, <title>Domestic Individualism: Imagining Self in Nineteenth-Century America</title> (Berkeley: U of California P, 1990), 150.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In Dickinson's late work two broad scriptural styles, two "hands," one for rough-copy drafts, another for fair-copy drafts, reflect and translate two different phases of the compositional process. The handwriting style for rough-copy drafts, which remained constant even throughout the late years, is also the style of the dictation&#8212;a way of writing in speaking: the hand jolts into action. "But ought not the | Amanuensis<hi rend="strike-out"> also</hi> to | receive a Commission also -" (A 844), Dickinson asked in the final decade of her life. Executed quickly&#8212;it is possible to imagine involuntarily&#8212;these drafts or inscriptions reveal the unmediated quickenings of thought before their coalescence into a "work." Here composition is a state of emergency or rapt attention. The cometary pace of thought determines Dickinson's choice of materials&#8212;whatever lies close by&#8212;and is registered in a pulsational writing that often almost bypasses recognizable alphabetic symbols: the script is sometimes small and angular, sometimes large and loose, text is often superimposed over text, fault lines interrupt the narrative, and along the margins words and solitary letters appear sideways and upside down. Drafting within the very physical drive of writing, Dickinson reminds us of the impossibility of discerning final or original intentions; instead, her gestural messages keep us focused on <hi rend="italics">trajectivity</hi>&#8212;on the path drawn by the hand in the present tense of writing.<note n="46">For a fascinating discussion of "trajectivity," see Paul Virilio, "The Perspective of Real Time," in <title>Open Sky,</title> 22&#8211;34.</note>

            <p>The autocracy of forms may thus find its end in a poetics of immediacy, in an extempore "notation on extreme states of emotion, jotted in the margins of the moment."<note n="47">Kathleen Fraser, "Overheard," <title>Poetics Journal</title> 4 (May 1984): 99.</note> Yet in the passage from rough-copy drafts to fair-copy drafts, as in the passage from one realm to another, the poetics of immediacy itself undergoes a change, escapes into what Kierkegaard called the "immediacy after reflection."<note n="48">SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, <title>Repetition,</title> translated by Howard and Edna Hong (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983), 350 n.</note> Dickinson's escape into the latter style, or hand, is at once signaled and accomplished through a practice&#8212;or, rather, a poetics&#8212;of copying in which calligraphy itself becomes expressive or aesthetic as it transcends the need to render the "fixed and unvarying forms of letters" and responds unconsciously to the chance ordering of words across the empty page.<note n="49">Roger Fry, <title>CÃ©zanne: A Study of His Development</title> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1989), xxiv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The hand Dickinson used in her fair-copy drafts changed dramatically over the course of her life. The traditional division of Dickinson's fair-copy drafts into three periods, though ultimately arbitrary, has assisted scholars in hypothesizing a working chronology for her largely undated writings; this periodization schema has in turn led to a clearer delineation of the boundaries of her style periods. In the manuscripts of the 1850s Dickinson's handwriting is small and flowing, upper- and lowercase letters are readily distinguishable, and most letters within words are linked. The characteristics and legibility of the early script suggest that Dickinson was modeling her hand after the exemplary hands of penmanship copybooks or, perhaps, the uniformity, though not the character, of print. In the 1860s, a period of profound poetic experimentation, Dickinson's calligraphy ceases to be simply recursive: the fixed alphabetic forms characteristic of the fair-copy hand of the 1850s are abandoned, the alignment of words on the page is irregular, and the extreme slant of the pen strokes gives the impression of a writer working under great strain. Finally, in the 1870s the handwriting of the fair-copy drafts evolves again. Dickinson's writing reaches its maximum size in the mid-1870s, and the unlinking of letters, begun in the early 1860s, is at this moment nearly complete, giving the manuscripts a new feeling of spaciousness. The strokes of the pencil&#8212;by 1879 Dickinson abandoned her pen for a pencil, perhaps also abandoning the permanent memory traces of ink for the more transient marks of lead&#8212;are centrifugal. The aim of copying no longer appears to be greater legibility but, rather, heightened visibility. Far from approximating the orderly pages of print, the fair-copy drafts resemble sketches in which Dickinson continually reopened the field of verbal-visual exchange in order to explore the relations among inscription, accident, and revisioning. In her late, fair-copy holographs, dashes often appear waved or wandlike, the ascenders and descenders of her "d"s and "y"s stream away from the letters, the crossbars of her "T"s detach from their stems and arrow out to the left or the right, and Dickinson's "O"s and "W"s appear as ciphers of an enigmatically open code. On the "spectrum from pure picture to pure letter," this writing is "at both ends at once."<note n="50">J. Hillis Miller, <title>Illustration</title> (London: Reaktion Books, 1992), 77. The passage reads: "He [Ruskin] understands that there is an element of writing in every picture. In an illuminated capital the one flows into the other. They are superimposed or interwoven. The place where one stops and the other begins can scarcely be detected. Where would one put an illuminated capital on my spectrum from pure picture to pure letter? It seems to be at both ends at once, therefore the locus of a battle between extremes."</note> Reading, once a strictly linear process, a reading within the rule, now requires the cultivation of an equally floating attention. </p>

                  <p>The type and number of texts inscribed across the body of this manuscript, as well as the relations between them, are unclear. The text beginning "Back from the Cordial | Grave I drag thee," inscribed on both sides of the manuscript, may be a radically compressed lyric poem or the nucleus of a lost or unfinished poem. A single stray mark visible along the bottom edge of the manuscript indicates that text&#8212;probably composed on a different occasion&#8212;has been lost beyond the tear. The canceled line, "The mower is | tuning his scythe," may be a trial beginning for the poem, crossed out when Dickinson started the poem over on the other side of the scrap, or it may be an unrelated text fragment, composed on an earlier occasion and canceled when Dickinson used the scrap to jot down the lines "Back from the Cordial | Grave I drag thee." Slight differences in handwriting (see especially changes in the letter "s") in the two texts suggest that they were composed on different occasions. The "B" of "Back" appears to have been overwritten.</p>

                  <p>The type and number of texts inscribed across the body of this manuscript, as well as the relations among them, are ambiguous. The lines "a similar mirage | of thought - | Bottle | Slip -" may be increments of a single text, or they may be discrete fragments unrelated to each other as well as to the longer   fragment-pensÃ©e that follows; alternatively, these isolated words and phrases may be the beginning of the longer text, "Nothing is so res - | onant with | mystery. . ." The consistency of the handwriting across the manuscript's surface at least suggests that the passages were all jotted down in the same scene of writing. All, moreover, beg an interpretation of absence&#8212;whether of the "mirage | of thought -" or of the vanished other ("friend"; "one"). As Dickinson composed, she also revised, canceling words and passages, substituting others, and setting down unresolved variants. A 867a constitutes a scene of revision: here Dickinson composed three trial variants for the final canceled passage on A 867. Each time she composed a new variant Dickinson rotated the paper one-quarter turn; the repetition of the variant passages may indicate that Dickinson was experiencing a brief compositional block, that she could not move beyond the lines, and so continued to retrace them until the act of retracing led her beyond the impasse.</p>

                  <p>These fragments, shifting between prose and verse, fall outside conventional genre categories; Dickinson's final intentions regarding them remain unknown. Moreover, while the two fragments arise on the same page and were almost certainly composed during the same scene of composition&#8212;the handwriting is uniform across the manuscript&#8212;the nature of their relationship to one another is not clear. The first fragment, beginning "Fly - fly - but as you fly -," appears to be the draft or nucleus of an unidentified or lost poem; the second fragment, beginning "Paradise is no Journey," and separated from the first by a broken horizontal line, may be an introduction to the poem-notes, a passage intended for incorporation into a letter, or a discrete pensÃ©e. As Dickinson wrote she also revised. In the first fragment she drew a broken horizontal line under "Ah the Responsibility - ," below which she composed the variant lines: "Such a (What a -) Responsibility." She appears to have gone through the text a second time with a sharpened pencil, canceling the variants below the horizontal line by drawing heavy vertical lines through them and adding yet another variant, "what a," supralinearly, with a different pencil. The interlineations in the fragment beginning "Paradise is no Journey," both the unresolved variant "he" and the addition "very," may also have been added at this time. Dickinson's use here of broken horizontal lines to mark both the limits of discrete, though possibly related, texts and to mark internal textual limits (i.e., to divide the body of the text from a variant reading) reminds us of the difficulty of interpreting boundaries within and between her texts. </p>

                  <p>This extrageneric fragment may be a passage destined for incorporation into a letter, notes toward a poem, or an autonomous pensÃ©e. Dickinson appears to have revised the fragment both during the initial drive of composition, first canceling the lines "before our | own comprehen | sion" and composing the variant lines "an Exclu | sion from  com | prehension" immediately following them, and later, after finishing a preliminary draft of the text, at which point she composed another variant for the canceled lines, "preliminary to our own," sideways along the right edge of the paper. At this time she may also have canceled the word "strange" and penciled the variant "amazing" sideways along the left edge of the paper. </p>

                  <p>This manuscript carries one of the most beautiful and mysterious texts found among Dickinson's late papers. Its presence among these papers suggests, moreover, that in the 1870s and 1880s she may have been working in a new form that oscillates between prose and verse. The language and cadence of the extrageneric fragment owe much to Dickinson's reading in the Bible; see especially "The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats" in Matthew 25:31&#8211;46: "And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. . . ." The text appears to be an intermediate-copy draft. Dickinson turned the sheet of stationery upside-down before composing the text but then wrote neatly within the rule. After filling the recto and verso of the first leaf, she completed the text on the recto of the second leaf. Dickinson made several internal revisions during the initial drive of composition, canceling words, substituting others, and setting down unresolved variants. Several of the interlineations, including the variant choices for "guide" ("gait"; "pace"); "gay" ("strange"); and "We have" ("There are"), were probably added at this time. Dickinson used wavy vertical lines and open brackets to cordon off variants added during the course of composition and, perhaps, to help direct the reader-writer's passage through the text. She appears to have gone through the draft a second time, at which point she may have canceled "sunny" and "one," and jotted down variants for "many" ("numbers"); "only" ("one"); "retire" ("Expire");  "occupying" ("ascertaining," "certifying -," "ratifying," "estimation"); "Heart" ("Head"); "befriends" ("provides"); and "and" ("but"). These variants, composed in a smaller hand, appear both supralinearly to the words they are alternates for, and sideways along the right edge of the paper. Dickinson may have intended to excerpt the brief, bracketed poem for use elsewhere; see <title><ref target="abbr.poem1955" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1955), P 1772 and <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), Appendix 9.</p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or a longer pensÃ©e; it may be an experiment in aphoristic form. The numerals "2" and "1," in Dickinson's hand, indicate a revision of word order. Although there is no text on the reverse side of the manuscript, a stray mark, possibly the numeral "2," is visible; it has not been transcribed.</p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form; or, possibly, a compressed lyric poem unrecognized as such because of the crudeness of its material container. The careful lineation of the text strongly suggests that it is verse. Dickinson added the variant "valor" for "iron" either during the course of composition or immediately afterward, when scanning the draft a second time; it appears above the line, in a smaller hand.</p>

                  <p>This extrageneric fragment may be a passage destined for incorporation in a letter, notes toward a poem, or an autonomous pensÃ©e. Dickinson appears to have revised the text both during the initial drive of composition, when she probably crossed out "which" and wrote "with which" on the following line, and again, immediately after completing a preliminary draft of the text, when she probably canceled the phrase "of Human | nature" and penciled in variants for "readily" ("cordially") and for "subject" ("theme"; "concurrence") above and below the line. The open bracket&#8212;"(more noble"&#8212;may direct the writer-reader's passage through the text.</p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form. Though the relationship between the text on A 539a and the canceled text on A 539 is unclear, both are composed in the same hand, and the canceled lines, the last three of which are variants for the first three, appear to complete the text inscribed on A 539a. Dickinson drew more than sixteen crossing lines through the text on A 539 to cancel it.  For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see T. H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 113, PF 122, respectively. </p>

                  <p>This fragment, now an extrageneric text ending in medias res, appears to have been excerpted from a longer composition, possibly a fair-copy letter-draft, since destroyed or lost. The author of the tears has not been positively identified; they may be the work of a censor or of Dickinson herself. Millicent Todd Bingham associated the manuscript with Dickinson's correspondence with Judge Otis P. Lord; no complete fair-copy of the manuscript has survived, however, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment remain unknown. </p>

                  <p>The type and number of texts inscribed across the body of this manuscript, as well as the relations among them, are ambiguous. The first (visible) fragment, beginning "Still (Stern) as the | Profile of a | Tree against," may be the nucleus of an unidentified or lost poem, a radically compressed poem, or an experiment in aphoristic form; above and separated from it by a horizontal line are several stray marks that may belong to this text, or to another text, canceled by tearing. The author of the tears has not been positively identified; they may be the work of a censor or of Dickinson herself. The second visible fragment, separated from the first by a horizontal line and beginning "I never heard | you call anything," appears to be a canceled message-fragment. Millicent Todd Bingham associated the text with Dickinson's correspondence with Judge Otis P. Lord; no complete fair-copy of the message to Lord, however, has come to light, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment remain unknown. The final, uncanceled lines may belong to the message-fragment or to the fragmentary notes above it, or they may be a very brief but autonomous text. The uniformity of the handwriting across the surface of the paper at least suggests that, whatever their relations to one another, the fragments were jotted down during the same scene of writing. Dickinson appears to have revised the texts both during the initial drive of writing, when she composed variants&#8212;"sunset sky -"; "evening -"&#8212;for "winter sky," and again, later, after completing a preliminary draft, when she probably canceled the opening of the message-fragment. Here Dickinson wrote against the rule of the paper.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper appear to constitute separate textual spaces. The fragment beginning "I should think a faded" is one of the many extrageneric texts found among Dickinson's late papers after her death; the fragment beginning "To . . . | might . . . | a climate of" may be related to the first fragment, or, as seems more likely, it may be the remains of a discrete text, preserved only because Dickinson used the other side of the manuscript to jot down another text. The relationship between the fragments, if a relationship beyond a material one exists, is ambiguous and will necessarily remain so: the act of scissoring that rendered a significant part of the fragment on A 861a unreadable also created an unbridgeable textual gap between fragments. Though both texts are composed in a rough-copy hand, subtle shifts in handwriting between them indicate that the fragments are discrete texts. The text "To . . . | might . . . | a climate of" appears to have been thrown onto the page; the reading order is unclear. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which opposite sides constitute separate textual spaces. The fair-copy text on A 760 appears to be an excerpt from a letter (unknown number of leaves missing). Millicent Todd Bingham associated the text with Dickinson's correspondence with Judge Otis P. Lord; no complete fair-copy of the letter to Lord, however, has survived, and the provenance of the text is not known. Dickinson drew five diagonal lines through the face of the fair-copy draft, canceling it before using the other side of the paper to compose the rough-copy fragment. The extrageneric rough-copy text on A 760a may be a passage destined for incorporation into a letter, notes toward a poem, or an autonomous pensÃ©e. The document was torn after Dickinson composed the fair-copy draft, but probably before she composed the rough-copy text, which is fitted into the space of the paper. The author of the tears has not been positively identified; they may be the work of a censor or, as seems more likely under the circumstances, of Dickinson herself. Dickinson revised the rough-copy fragment both during the initial drive of composition, when she jotted down and then canceled the variant "how" for "it is," and again after completing a preliminary draft, when she probably composed yet another variant, "discover that it is," for the same phrase; the second variant is composed sideways along the left edge of the paper.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. The brief fragment on the inside of the envelope was composed after the envelope was cut apart; the text on the torn face of the envelope&#8212;a partial address to Otis P. Lord&#8212;may have been preserved only because Dickinson used the reverse side to jot down the rough-copy fragment. Although unlikely, it is possible that Dickinson associated Lord with secrecy, "seals," and that a more than material relation exists between the texts. Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or a longer pensÃ©e; it may be an experiment in aphoristic form. After jotting down the fragment, Dickinson wrote "- which," probably a variant for "that -," sideways along the right edge of the envelope. </p>

It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form; or, possibly, a compressed lyric poem unrecognized as such because of the crudeness of its material container. Dickinson may have added the variant "Boy" for "Child" either during the initial drive of composition, or later, when reading through the draft a second time. The variant appears supralinearly and in a smaller hand. </p>

It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition. In its present form, it appears to be a list of variant (or additional) word choices, perhaps for a poem-draft since lost, destroyed, or beyond positive identification. The variant, "by duller," for "to duller," appears to have occurred to Dickinson during the initial drive of composition. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. The fair-copy text on A 444 is a poem, the first line of which has been lost beyond the tear. An unmutilated variant copy of the poem (H 353), also written around 1879 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), survives and supplies what is probably the missing line: "The Sweets of | Pillage, can be known." The rough-copy text on A 444a may be a passage destined for incorporation into the body of a letter, notes toward a poem, or an autonomous lyric pensÃ©e. Dickinson appears to have revised the rough-copy text both during the initial drive of composition, when she penciled in a variant, "acre," for "tillage," and again after completing a preliminary draft, when she probably canceled the word "best" and composed a variant passage for lines 5&#8211;8 of the text in the empty space below the text proper. Dickinson drew a horizontal line below the text proper, presumably to separate the body of the text from the variant passage; she revised the variant passage as she composed it, canceling "quivered" and substituting "rumbled."</p>
                  <p>Two editorial notations are penciled on the manuscript: A 444, top, right, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr> (?): <hi rend="italics">109;</hi> A 444a, bottom, partly erased, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics">"The Sweets of Pillage."</hi> Both notations identify the earliest published source of the lines as <title>The Single Hound</title> (1914), 109.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. The text on A 156 is a rough-copy poem-draft; the canceled text on A 156a is an autonomous passage, possibly destined for incorporation into the body of a letter; alternatively, it may be notes for a poem; or, possibly, a brief, autonomous pensÃ©e. Although the uniformity of the handwriting across the manuscript suggests both texts were probably composed during the same scene of writing, their relationship to one another is unclear. Here again, Dickinson revised as she wrote, adding variant words and lines but never returning to resolve them. Though she ultimately canceled the text on A 156a, she let the poem-draft on A 156 stand. A transcript of a variant version of the poem made by Mabel Loomis Todd survives (A 156b); no autograph copy of this variant has been located. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. The fair-copy text on A 864v appears to be an excerpt from a letter, or, possibly, a very brief but complete message; the rough-copy text on A 864 is an extrageneric fragment, possibly destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or a longer pensÃ©e. Dickinson revised the rough-copy text as she wrote, canceling "occupations" and substituting "entertainments." This fragment was probably composed after Dickinson abandoned the fair-copy message-fragment and after the paper was torn and scissored. It is possible, however, that Dickinson wished to associate the two texts. The scissoring has been done carefully&#8212;only the cross of the "T" of "Thank" has been sheared off&#8212;perhaps suggesting that she cut the document herself. The nature of the association, if indeed an association exists, remains unknown and is probably unrecoverable.</p>

                  <p>The relationship between the fragments on the opposite sides of the manuscript is ambiguous; stray marks along the top and bottom scissored edges of A 871 and along the top scissored edge of A 871a are evidence of a textual gap that cannot be bridged. These extrageneric fragments may be passages marked for incorporation into a single composition; unrelated passages, each destined for incorporation into a different composition; or discrete texts, one or both of which may be freestanding pensÃ©es. It is also possible that Dickinson used A 871a as a space of revision&#8212;a space for sketching out a series of alternate openings or closings for the text on A 871. The text on A 871a is largely composed out of variants: lines 3&#8211;5 are echoed in lines 6&#8211;8; lines 9 and 10 are variants of each other; and lines 14 and 15 are variants of each other. Though the handwriting across both sides of the manuscript is similar, the handwriting on A 871a is looser and less precise than that on A 871, suggesting, perhaps, an exploratory or revisionary phase. Here Dickinson revised as she wrote, crossing out "One" and "anew" and penciling in variants "a" and "forever," and canceling a false start, "and this my," before revising the line to read "This mystic territory." The ambiguous mark following the word "single," here rendered "/," may be the numeral "1" or a private form of punctuation used to guide the writer-reader's eye through the text. </p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form; or, possibly, a compressed lyric poem unrecognized as such because of the crudeness of its material container. The stray marks just visible along the top edge of the paper indicate that text has been lost beyond the tear; the lost text may have been part of the extant fragment, perhaps deliberately cut away by Dickinson in an act of revision, or part of another text, cut away when she recycled the paper to compose the extant lines. As Dickinson wrote, she also revised, penciling in the variant "terrible" for "dreadful." An ambiguous mark of punctuation, here rendered "/," appears in the text beside the word "sorrow." It may be a comma, a semicolon, or a private form of punctuation used to guide the writer-reader's eye through the text. </p>

The text is also a paraphrase&#8212;and revision&#8212;of Proverbs 22:6: "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Here Dickinson wrote against the blue rule of the stationery but fit her text into the odd space of the paper. </p>

                  <p>The relationship between the fragments on the opposite sides of the manuscript is ambiguous; tears along the top and bottom edges of the manuscript have created textual gaps that cannot be bridged. The fragments may be passages from a single, though incomplete, composition; unrelated passages, each destined for incorporation into a different composition; or discrete texts. If the passages are part of the same text, as the uniformity of the handwriting across the manuscript suggests, it is possible that Dickinson used A 876a as a space of revision&#8212;a space to sketch out a series of alternate openings or closings for the fragment on A 876. Indeed, the first eight lines of the text on A 876a may be variants for lines 6&#8211;14 of the text on A 876. The final (incomplete) lines of the text on A 876a, however, seem more personal; they may be notes for another text, either never composed or lost. Though there are no local cancelations in the text on A 876a, Dickinson drew six intersecting lines through it, further suggesting that this side of the manuscript was a scene of exploration and revision, canceled when she decided to let the text on A 876 stand as it appears. Here again Dickinson revised the text as she wrote, canceling the word "and" and inscribing the variant "but" above it and, on the next line, striking out "it." She wrote in the same direction as the red rule but without regard for its boundaries. </p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form. Though the relationship between the texts on the opposite sides of the manuscript is ambiguous, the handwriting is uniform across the manuscript, and the lines on the A 852a appear to complete the text on A 852. For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see Thomas H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958): PF 73 and PF 64, respectively. Dickinson may have penciled in variants for "gave" ("left") and "dont" ("wont") either during the initial drive of composition or immediately after finishing a preliminary draft. The variant word choices appear just below the words to which they refer, in a smaller hand. One stray letter, possibly an "e," and two additional stray marks appear along the bottom edge of A 852a; the "e" appears perpendicular to the text of the fragment and probably belongs to an earlier text, perhaps cut away when Dickinson recycled the paper to jot down the extant lines. </p>

                  <p>These five extrageneric fragments, shifting between prose and verse, fall outside conventional genre categories; their relations to one another and Dickinson's final intentions toward them remain ambiguous. All or some may be passages destined for incorporation into a single letter or a longer composition, brief, autonomous pensÃ©es, or the nuclei of poems. Though separated from one another by broken horizontal lines, the fragments are composed in the same hand and were almost certainly jotted down in the same scene of writing. It may be that Dickinson was trying to create a more permanent record of her fragments by copying a series of unrelated texts onto a single sheet of paper. If so, the record is still an unstable one: variant words and lines occurred to her both during the course of copying and after she completed the transcriptions. Five "+" marks scattered throughout the text identify the points where variant readings may enter. The cross-references between the "principal" text and the variants are not always clear, and, in the case of the text beginning "+Dim is the Heavenly | prospective,"  several possible readings of Dickinson's lines emerge. The encoding of variants here is tentative.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. Still, it is possible that Dickinson wished to preserve both fragments and even to associate them. The scissoring has been done carefully, so that both texts are preserved. The rough-copy text on A 785 is an extrageneric fragment, possibly destined for incorporation into a poem, letter, or other composition; the fair-copy text on the reverse is an address to Mabel Loomis Todd. The provenance and transmission history of the document are unclear. It is unlikely, despite Mabel Loomis Todd's claim, that the document was sent to her: Dickinson did not send rough-copy drafts out of her workshop. A single stray pencil mark appears on A 785, below the text of the fragment and along the right-hand edge of the paper; it may belong to an earlier text now lost beyond the tear. </p>

                  <p>This text, now a freestanding extrageneric fragment, appears to have been excerpted from a longer composition: three stray marks along the scissored bottom edge of the manuscript are evidence that text is missing from the end of the fragment as well as from its beginning. The author of the cuts has not been identified; they may be the work of a censor or of Dickinson herself. Millicent Todd Bingham associated the manuscript with Dickinson's correspondence with Judge Otis P. Lord; no complete fair-copy of the letter to Lord, however, has survived, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment remain unknown.</p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form. The blank space separating the first two lines, "Of our deepest delights | there is a solemn shyness," from the next five, "The appetite | for silence | is seldom | an acquired | taste," may indicate that the passages constitute discrete texts; however, the absence of other lines of demarcation, such as the horizontal lines Dickinson often drew to indicate the limits of a text, and the tonal similarity of the passages suggest that the lines belong to the same text. For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see Thomas H. Johnson's <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 96 and 106, respectively. Dickinson's handwriting fills the white spaces of the program's margins and then traverses the space between the printed lines. The text of the fragment, which concerns "shyness" and "silence," may constitute an ironic comment on the printed text's announcement of an organ concert.</p>

                  <p>Dickinson used the faces (A 175, A 175a) of both leaves to compose a rough-copy poem-draft and the reverse side (A 175b) of the first leaf to compose a rough-copy message-fragment as well as several lines that may be associated with the message-fragment, or, alternatively, may constitute an autonomous pensÃ©e. A 175 and A 175a may carry successive "stanzas" of a poem (compositional order unclear) or, rather, two variants of a single "stanza." The relations between and among the texts crossing A 175b are complex and ambiguous. Dickinson's rotations of the paper may suggest textual breaks or simply redirections of thought. Moreover, the single wavy line drawn through the text on A 175b may be a mark of cancellation or it may be an "arrow," connecting passages in the text(s) and suggesting a direction for writing-reading. Finally, the lines "Love first and | last of all things | made | of which this (our) | living world is | but the shade," which recall lines from Swinburne's "Tristram of Lyonesse," "Love, that is first and last of all things made, / The light that has the living world for shade," also resonate with lines in the poem-draft on A 175 / 175a, suggesting further, inter- and intratextual links between all of the texts inscribed across the manuscript.

Johnson's <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 24, PF 41, respectively.</p>

                  <p>One of the many brief extrageneric texts found among her late papers after her death, Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be an experiment in aphoristic form; or, possibly, a compressed lyric poem unrecognized as such because of the crudeness of its material container. Though the relationship between the texts on the opposite sides of the manuscript is unclear, both are composed in the same hand and the lines on A 523 rhyme with the lines on the A 523a. The lines on A 523a may complete the text on A 523, or, since the reverse side of a manuscript often appears to be a scene of revision, they may be variants for lines on A 523. One word on A 523a, here uncertainly transcribed as "Below," may read "Beloved"; it is composed sideways along the left edge of the paper and is partially lost beyond the tear. This single word may belong to an earlier text, lost beyond the tear, or to the present text, with which it also rhymes. For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see T. H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 123, PF 121, respectively. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. The text on A 840a appears to be the remains of a canceled, rough-copy message-fragment, addressee unknown; the text on A 840 is a rough-copy, extrageneric fragment possibly destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or a longer pensÃ©e. The text on A 840a, most of which has been lost beyond the cut, appears to have been saved only because Dickinson recycled the other side of the paper to jot down the extrageneric fragment. Two intersecting pencil lines on A 840, one along the left edge of the paper and another along the bottom edge, indicate that Dickinson may have been bounding this fragment off from another text, now lost beyond the cut; if so, she may have cut the paper in an act of revision or as a way of ensuring the integrity of the extant fragment.</p>

                  <p>Dickinson's final intentions toward these rough-copy fragments, several of which shift between prose and verse, remain unknown. The text on A 887, a draft of a message to Gilbert Dickinson, appears to be a discrete text, though it may be the beginning (or ending) of the text on A 887a, "Is not the Election | of a Daphne much (more) | more signal than | that of a President - . . . ." Alternatively, the fragment beginning "Is not the Election" may be a discrete pensÃ©e, or notes related to the three extrageneric passages also arising on A 887a, though oriented perpendicular to this text. These three extrageneric fragments, separated from one another by horizontal lines, and represented here as a single text, may also be the nuclei of unwritten or lost poems, or experiments in aphoristic form. Dickinson revised as she wrote, composing variants for "much" ("more") and "and" ("for").  She appears to have gone through the texts a second time, when she perhaps composed the variant "Exhilaration of fools" for "hurry of fools" sideways along the left edge of the paper. For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see Thomas H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 36, 62, 69, respectively.</p>

                  <p>This fragment is one of a small number of apparently autobiographical texts found among Dickinson's late papers after her death. It may have been destined for incorporation into a longer composition, possibly a letter, or an extended autobiographical meditation either never composed or long since lost. Dickinson composed a variant for the opening "We" ("he") but did not alter the rest of the text to be consistent with the proposed change. The adoption of the variant reading might well remove the fragment from the space of autobiography. Traces of an unidentified handwriting appear along the top edge of the reverse side of the first fragment.</p>

                  <p>This fragment, shifting between prose and verse, is one of a small number of apparently autobiographical texts found among Dickinson's late papers after her death. It may have been destined for incorporation into a longer composition, possibly a letter, or an extended autobiographical meditation either never composed or long since lost. Dickinson appears to have revised the draft both as she wrote, adding the variant "wading" for the part-word "grop" ("groping"?), and  writing "more for,"  immediately after canceling "for," and later, after completing a preliminary draft, when she probably canceled the lines, "now mother | and Card | inal flower | are parts | of a | closed | world -." The lines on A 878a appear to complete the text on A 878. For a different interpretation of textual boundaries, see T. H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), PF 117, PF 71, respectively. Traces of an unidentified handwriting appear along the bottom edge of A 878a.</p>

                  <p>Though this fragment, composed around 1863 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) or 1864 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), is a relatively early text, its connection with a fragment composed in the 1870s argues for its inclusion here. A 100, by itself a brief lyric throe, appears as a trace in two other documents: first, as a variant trace (text altered) in the poem beginning "A Drop fell on the | Apple Tree -" <ref target="H159.TXT.1">(H 159)</ref> and composed around 1863 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) or 1864 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); and second, as a variant (text altered) of another extrageneric fragment<ref target="A313.TXT.1">(A 313)</ref> composed many years later, possibly around 1873 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1874 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), when Dickinson returned to revise "A Drop fell on the | Apple Tree -." The early fragment (A 100) may have catalyzed the composition of the first version of the poem; or, it may have been an early reworking of the last lines of the second stanza. It may also have catalyzed the composition of the later fragment (A 313 / 314), which, composed around 1873 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1874 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), seems to have immediately proceeded the composition of the last extant version of the poem (H 332). Interestingly, the revised version of the poem (H 322) begins with the third stanza of the earlier version and does not include the fragment traces. Such fragments, while belonging to the constellation of texts that includes the poems in which they reappear as traces, may also claim the status of independent or autonomous texts.</p>

                  <p>This brief, extrageneric fragment appears as a trace in two other documents, both composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>): first, in a fair-copy poem-draft, with alternatives, beginning, "A Sloop of | Amber slips away" <ref target="A386.TXT.1">(A 386),</ref> where it appears as the final (variant) lines of the draft; and second, as a "rhyming" trace (text altered) in a fair-copy of the same poem incorporated into a letter-draft possibly intended for Professor Tuckerman; see <ref target="A836.TXT.1">A 836.</ref> A 112 offers additional evidence of an affinity between fragments and variants. Here a single horizontal pencil line is still visible along the torn top edge of the manuscript, and, since Dickinson frequently drew horizontal lines to separate the body of a poem from its variants, it is likely that this scrap carries variant lines torn away from their original body. Like the variant word choices rowing below so many of Dickinson's poems in the manuscript volumes, the late fragments constitute evidence of a crisis of and at the limits of texts. Unlike the variant word choices in the manuscript volumes, however, the late fragments appear outside the trace poems' gravitational fields; materially speaking, such fragments often attain the status of radically compressed but independent texts.</p>

                  <p>This brief, extrageneric fragment appears as a trace in two other documents, both composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>): first, as a trace (lineation and punctuation altered) in a poem beginning "Her Losses make | our Gains ashamed -" and embedded into a letter to Thomas Niles <ref target="A833.TXT.1">(A 833);</ref> second, as a trace (lineation and punctuation altered) in a variant draft of the poem beginning "His Losses made | our Gains ashamed -" and embedded in a letter sent to Susan Dickinson <ref target="H266.TXT.1">(H 266).</ref> In both instances, the trace appears in the poems' concluding lines. A 207 thus offers evidence of an affinity between fragments and variants: like the variant word choices rowing below so many of Dickinson's poems in the manuscript volumes, the late fragments constitute evidence of a crisis of and at the limits of texts. Unlike the variant word choices in the manuscript volumes, however, the late fragments appear outside the trace poems' gravitational fields; materially speaking, such fragments often attain the status of radically compressed but independent texts. Two diagonal slashes on the manuscript of A 207 almost certainly indicate metrical line breaks. It is possible that other lines followed the second slash, which appears along the scissored right edge of the document. These lines may have been deliberately cut away in an act of revision. </p>

                  <p>These fragments, separated by horizontal lines and shifting between prose and verse, fall outside conventional genre categories; their relations to one another and Dickinson's final intentions toward them are only partially revealed. It is possible that she was copying unrelated fragments onto a single writing surface in order to create a more permanent record of them. Of the four fragments two reappear as traces in other texts. The first fragment, "immured in | Heaven - what | a Cell -," appears as the opening lines of a poem-letter composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) and sent to Susan Dickinson <ref target="JONES.TXT.1">(Jones);</ref> it may also appear, much altered, in a poem embedded in the draft of a letter to Helen Hunt Jackson composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) and containing the lines, "Immured the whole | of Life | Within a magic | Prison | We reprimand the | Happiness | That too com- | petes with Heaven -" <ref target="A819.TXT.1">(A 819).</ref> The (silent) quotation from <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> (II.ii.225&#8211;226) in the third fragment, "With thanks | for my health | I send you | Antony's | Orchard - | who paid his | Heart for | what his | Eyes ate, | only -," appears altered and in quotation marks in a message to Susan Dickinson <ref target="HCLB24.TXT.1">(HCL B 24)</ref> composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), and, later, in a message to Ned Dickinson <ref target="HCLB118.TXT.1">(HCL B 118)</ref> composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). The remaining fragments do not reappear in any other extant compositions by Dickinson. The first autonomous fragment, "Undertow of | the Organ," may be the nucleus of a lost or unwritten poem or, alternatively, a breakaway line from a poem, a letter, or other composition not yet identified. The second autonomous fragment, beginning "Solomon says," may be a brief but complete pensÃ©e, a passage destined for incorporation into another composition, perhaps a letter or a longer meditation; it contains an allusion to Solomon's feast in 1 Kings 8:65. The final text, a poem-draft beginning "Lad of Athens," is embedded in a letter to an unidentified recipient, possibly Samuel Bowles Jr.<ref target="A713.TXT.1">(A 713),</ref> composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). A single stray mark is visible along the right edge of A 249; it does not appear to belong to the extant texts.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper appear to constitute separate textual spaces. A 254, an autonomous, extrageneric fragment, may have been destined for incorporation into a poem, a letter, or another composition; alternatively, it may be a radically compressed poem-draft unrecognized as such because of the crudeness of its material container. Though no conclusive evidence exists to prove that it is a verse fragment, two features strongly suggest it is: first, the careful lineation of the text; and, second, the presence of a horizontal pencil line, the same kind of line often used to separate the body of a poem from its variants, along the scissored top edge of the document. A 255, by itself an extrageneric fragment, appears as a trace or a variant trace in five documents composed between 1875 and 1877: an unbound, fair-copy draft of the poem beginning, "After all | Birds have | been investigated" and composed about 1875 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or about 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) <ref target="A94-1.TXT.1">(A 94-1 / 2);</ref> a rough- or intermediate-copy draft of the second stanza beginning "First at the | March" and composed about 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) <ref target="A127.TXT.1">(A 127);</ref> an unbound fair-copy draft of the last lines of the poem beginning "Last to | adhere | When Summers | swerve away -" and composed about 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) <ref target="A298.TXT.1"> (A 298);</ref> an identical fair-copy draft of the poem's final lines beginning "Last to | adhere | When Summers | swerve away -" and sent to Samuel Bowles about 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]) <ref target="A711.TXT.1">(A 711);</ref> and a later, variant fair-copy of "After all | Birds have | been investigated" enclosed in a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson about 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) <ref target="BPLHIGG35.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 35).</ref> R. W. Franklin suggests that A 255 was composed after A 298 and A 711, but before BPL Higg 35, since the fair-copy to Higginson reflects some of the changes introduced in the previous drafts. The definitive compositional history of the textual constellation, however, remains open to speculation. In all instances the trace appears in the texts' concluding lines. A 255 thus offers some evidence of an affinity between fragments and variants: like the variant word choices rowing below so many of Dickinson's poems in the manuscript volumes, the late fragments constitute evidence of a crisis of and at the limits of texts. Unlike the variant word choices in the manuscript volumes, however, the late fragments appear outside the trace poems' gravitational fields; materially speaking, such fragments often attain the status of radically compressed but independent texts. A 254 and A 255, written in slightly different hands, probably on different occasions, are almost certainly discrete texts. Still, since Dickinson jotted down the two fragments on the same scrap, not canceling either but, rather, carefully preserving both, they may in some way be related. The fragments appear to have been composed over the pen tests and practice signatures. </p>
                  <p>One editorial notation is penciled on A 255: sideways in the right margin, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics">after all birds.</hi> The notation may have been made when Bingham sorted through the documents left unpublished by her mother, noting cross-references with previously published texts. </p>

                  <p>This brief, extrageneric fragment appears as a trace in two other documents, both composed around 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>): first, as a trace in an incomplete poem-draft beginning "Most Arrows | slay but whom | they strike -" <ref target="A637.TXT.1">(A 637);</ref> and, second, as a variant trace (text altered) in another version of the poem beginning "Some Arrows | slay but whom | they strike" and embedded in a letter to Susan Dickinson <ref target="HCLB145.TXT.1">(HCL B 145).</ref> In this case it is the first, "arrow" line of the poem, rather than the final lines, that achieves its own independent&#8212;lyric&#8212;trajectory. One stray pencil mark along the torn top edge of A 287 suggests that the fragment may have been torn away from its body. Corresponding pin holes on A 287 and A 637 indicate that the fragment and message-draft were at one time physically associated. In addition to appearing as a trace in A 637, A 287 may be obliquely connected with the text on <ref target="A637.TXT.2">A 637a:</ref> "Tis a dange | rous moment | for any one | when the meaning | goes out of things | and Life stands | straight - and | punctual X and | yet no contents (signal) | come[s] | Yet such mo | ments are | If we survive (survive) | them they Expand | us, if we do | not, but that | is Death, X whose | if is Everlasting | when I was a | little girl I called | the Cemetery | Tarry Town | but now I | call it Trans - | A wherefore | but no more | and X the if | of Deity - Avalanche | or Avenue - Every | Heart asks which." A single passage from the text on A 637 appears, altered, in a letter to Catharine Dickinson Sweetser <ref target="ROSENBACH.TXT.1">(Rosenbach 1170 / 18 [26]), </ref> also possibly composed around 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>): "I thought | the Churchtown | Tarrytown, when | I was a Child, | but now I trust | 'tis Trans -." The following line of the letter, "In this place of | shafts, I hope | you may remain | unharmed -," however, appears to allude not to the text on A 637a but, rather, to the text on A 637 and, again, to the fragment. The "Arrows" of A 287, pinned to A 637 / A 637a, are unpinned and translated into the "shafts" that enter the fair-copy letter to Sweetser. The "Arrow" text thus demonstrates how fragments catalyze the migration and transmigration of meanings and intentions.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposing sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. A 295 carries an extrageneric fragment that appears as a variant trace (text altered) in the poem beginning "No man saw awe, nor to his house" and possibly composed around 1874 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). The manuscript of this poem has been lost; only Mabel Loomis Todd's transcript <ref target="A295A.TXT.1">(A 295a),</ref> survives. In Todd's transcript of the poem the trace breaches stanzas, constituting the last line of the first stanza and the first line of the second stanza; Dickinson's original arrangement of the poem may have differed from Todd's. Stray marks visible along the scissored bottom edge of A 295 indicate that lines belonging to this text or, perhaps to another, unrelated text have been lost. They may have been cut away in an act of revision, or when Dickinson decided to jot down the text on the reverse side. A 296 also carries a fragment so brief that, by itself, it remains generically undecidable; however, the careful lineation of the text as well as its reappearance as a variant or rhyming trace (text altered) in five manuscripts of the poem beginning "The last of | Summer is | Delight," all composed around 1875&#8211;1876 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>; <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), indicate that A 296 is verse. The manuscripts associated with A 296 are, respectively, an initial rough-copy draft of the poem <ref target="A404.TXT.1">(A 404);</ref> a re-working of the rough-copy draft's opening lines <ref target="A405.TXT.1">(A 405);</ref> a fair-copy trial beginning <ref target="A94-13.TXT.1">(A 94-13);</ref> a complete fair-copy draft <ref target="H380A.TXT.1">(H 380);</ref> and a fair-copy enclosed in a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG30.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 30).</ref> R. W. Franklin speculates that A 296 was composed after A 405, since it offers an alternate reading for the poem's second line. The compositional history, however, remains ambiguous. A 295 and A 296, written in slightly different hands, perhaps on different occasions, are almost certainly discrete texts. Still, since Dickinson jotted down the two fragments on the same scrap, not canceling either but, rather, carefully preserving both texts, they may in some way be related. </p>

                  <p>The relationship between the two extrageneric fragments inscribed across the inside of the torn envelope and separated only by a horizontal pencil line is unknown. Though no link beyond a material one has ever been established between them, it is nonetheless possible that the texts are connected. Dickinson used horizontal lines not only to mark the boundaries of discrete texts but also to mark internal textual divisions&#8212;stanza and line breaks, for example&#8212;and to separate the body of a poem from its variants. Thus, A 313 and A 314 may be increments of a single (lost) poem or other composition. Alternatively, "A 313 / 314" may together constitute a new, hitherto unrecognized because radically compressed, text. Both fragments appear, separately, as traces in different poems. A 313 appears as a trace in two other documents: first, as a late variant version (text altered) of an early verse fragment, "Myself computed were they | Pearls | What affluence could be -"<ref target="A100.TXT.1">(A 100),</ref> possibly composed in 1863 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) or 1864 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); and, again, as a variant trace (text altered) in the poem beginning "A Drop fell on the | Apple Tree -" <ref target="H159.TXT.1">(H 159)</ref> and also composed around 1863 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) or 1864 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). A 313 may have been composed (recalled?) when Dickinson returned to revise "A Drop fell on the | Apple Tree -" in the 1870s, at least ten years after composing and copying the text into a manuscript volume. Though A 313 does not reappear as a trace in the later version of the poem (H 322), which begins with the third stanza of the earlier version, it may nonetheless have been the point of departure for the late compositional process. A 314 appears in two variant versions of the poem beginning "'Remember me' | implored the Thief!" ("'Remember me; | implored the | Thief -"): first, as a variant or rhyming trace (text altered) in a fair-copy draft of the poem <ref target="A93-7.TXT.1">(A 93-7)</ref> composed around 1871 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), and, second, as an exact trace in a later, fair-copy of the poem <ref target="H307.TXT.1">(H 307)</ref> composed and sent to Susan Dickinson around  around 1873 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1874 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>).  It may have been composed between the first and second versions, since the second fair-copy (H 307) to Sue reflects change of wording offered in the fragment.</p>
                  <p>If Johnson's and Franklin's dating schemes are correct, both A 313 and A 314 were composed long after the first versions of the poems with which they are associated. Thus, just as poems often evolve out of fragments, so they often break down into fragments again, after attaining, briefly, a finished form. These fragments, while belonging to the constellation of texts that includes the poems in which they appear as traces, may also achieve the status of freestanding lyrics. </p>

                  <p>The relationship between the two extrageneric fragments inscribed across the inside of the envelope flap and separated only by a vertical pencil line is ambiguous. Though no link beyond a material one has ever been established between them, it is nonetheless possible that the vertical line does not divide two discrete texts but, rather, marks internal textual divisions (lines, stanzas) of a single, hitherto unrecognized text, "A 351 / 352." Alternatively, A 351, which does not reappear in any other extant composition, may be the nucleus of an unwritten or lost poem, or, perhaps, a radically compressed but autonomous poem. A 352, a single lyric throe too brief to be positively identified as verse by itself, appears as a variant trace (text altered) in two substantively identical fair copies of the poem beginning "Step lightly on | this narrow spot -" ("Step lightly | on this narrow | Spot") and composed around 1871 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). One fair-copy draft of the poem was found among Dickinson's papers after her death; see <ref target="A95-12.TXT.1">A 95-12 / 13;</ref> the other  fair-copy was enclosed in a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG26.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 26).</ref> A copy of the first stanza of the poem (H 322), not including the trace, was sent to Susan Dickinson, also around 1871.</p>
                  <p>The discrepancy in dating schemes offered by Thomas H. Johnson and R. W. Franklin for A 352 is interesting. Franklin's dating and his arrangements of the texts for " document suggest that A 352 was an avant-text, composed just slightly in advance of A 95-12 / 13, the 1871 version of the poem in which it appears as a trace. Johnson's dating suggests instead that it is an aprÃ¨s-text, composed after the 1871 poem in which it appears as a trace. Both versions of dating are at least possible, since just as Dickinson's poems often evolve out of fragments, so they often break down into fragments again, after attaining, sometimes only briefly, a finished form. In either case, A 352, while belonging to the constellation of texts that includes the poem in which it appears as a (variant) trace, may also be an independent or autonomous text. </p>

                  <p>The number of texts inscribed across the manuscript, as well as the relations among them, are ambiguous. On A 361 a single line of text, separated by a broken horizontal line from a poem-draft, may be a brief introduction to the poem, a line associated with the text on the reverse side, or a discrete fragment, unrelated to the other texts. The poem-draft beginning, "Such (These) are the inlets of | the mind -," and composed around 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), may or may not be complete; a horizontal pencil line still partly visible along the bottom edge of the manuscript perhaps indicates that other stanzas, lost or deliberately excised when the paper was torn away, followed this one. The words, "Table Land," composed in a slightly different hand and in a lighter pencil, appear to have been added later.

                  <p>This brief, extrageneric fragment appears to be the trial beginning for the rough-copy poem-draft beginning "There is no Frigate | like a Book" <ref target="A462.TXT.1">(A 462)</ref> and composed around 1873 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). One letter of the fragment is marked "unclear": it may be an "a" or a "W."  In addition to appearing as a trace (lineation and punctuation altered) in the rough-copy poem-draft, the fragment appears as a trace in a (destroyed) fair-copy of the poem sent to the Norcrosses around 1873 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). Though the manuscript sent to the Norcrosses has been destroyed, Frances Norcross prepared a transcript of it for Mabel Loomis Todd in the 1890s; see <ref target="TRA43A.TXT.1">(Tr A 43a).</ref> One additional manuscript of the poem, carrying only the lines of the second stanza and not including the trace, is extant, though its present location is unknown; a photostat of the stanza is held by the Jones Library, Inc. </p>

                  <p>On A 510a Dickinson jotted down a recipe, the end of which has been lost beyond the tear. She may have torn the sheet away in order to isolate the fragments on the reverse side. The relationship between the two extrageneric fragments, A 509 and A 510, inscribed across one side of the manuscript and separated only by a horizontal pencil line, is unknown. Though no link beyond a material one has ever been established between them, it is nonetheless possible that the texts are connected in other ways. Dickinson used horizontal lines not only to mark the boundaries of discrete texts but also to separate the body of a poem from its variants and to mark internal textual divisions&#8212;stanza and line breaks, for example. Thus, A 509 and A 510, by themselves radically compressed yet autonomous lyric throes, may together constitute a new, hitherto unrecognized text, "A 509 / 510." Both A 509 and A 510 appear, separately, as traces in other texts. A 509 appears as a trace in five copies of the poem beginning, "We like March -" ("We like March - his"; "We like | March - his"; "We like March -"; "News is He"): as a variant trace (text altered) in a fair-copy of the poem <ref target="H369.TXT.1">(H 369)</ref> composed around 1871 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1872 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) and sent to Susan Dickinson; as a trace (lineation and punctuation altered) in a later, intermediate-copy draft of the poem <ref target="A508.TXT.1">(A 508)</ref> composed around 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); again as a trace (lineation and punctuation altered) in two fair-copy drafts&#8212;<ref target="A511.TXT.1">A 511,</ref> 
                     <ref target="PRINCETON.TXT.1">Princeton</ref>&#8212;also both composed around 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); and, finally, as a trace (lineation altered) in a fair-copy of the final lines of the poem <ref target="A786.TXT.1">(A 786)</ref> signed "March" and possibly sent to Mabel Loomis Todd around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). A 509, inscribed with a variant of the poem's last lines, may have been Dickinson's point of departure for the 1878 version of the poem. A 510 appears as a variant trace (text altered) in a rough-copy draft of the poem "The inundation of | the Spring" <ref target="H338.TXT.1">(H 338),</ref> composed in the 1870s (Smith and Hart), possibly in 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>).  In <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), R. W. Franklin indicates that A 510 was composed before H 338, but it is also possible that it was composed after the rough-copy poem-draft.  It is inscribed in a hand that has at least some characteristics in common with Dickinson's fair-copy hand; moreover, it offers a new textual variant. A 509 and A 510 offer evidence of the affinity between fragments and variants: like the variant word choices rowing below so many of Dickinson's poems in the manuscript volumes, these late fragments, appearing, respectively, as traces in the concluding lines of the poems  "We like March -" and "The inundation of | the Spring," suggest a crisis of and at the limits of texts. Unlike the variant word choices in the manuscript volumes, however, the late fragments appear outside the trace poems' gravitational fields; materially speaking, at least, they attain the status of radically compressed but independent texts. </p>
                  <p>The composition dates assigned by Thomas H. Johnson and R. W. Franklin to the texts in this constellation have interesting implications for a study of Dickinson's compositional process. Johnson and Franklin assign a composition date of "1877" to both A 510 and to the poem-draft in which A 510 appears as a trace. If, as seems likely given the arrangement of the lines on the page, A 509 and A 510 were composed at, or at least around, the same time, it would appear that A 509 was composed no less than five years after the first version of "We like March -" (1871 or 1872), in which it appears as a variant trace, and up to a year before the later versions of the poem, in which it appears as an exact trace. Thus, just as poems often evolve out of fragments, so they often break down into fragments again, after attaining, sometimes only briefly, a finished form. As both avant- and aprÃ¨s-texts, such fragments may also attain the status of independent texts. </p>

                  <p>This extrageneric fragment, by itself an autonomous lyric throe, appears as a variant trace (text altered) in two versions&#8212;<ref target="A514.TXT.1">A 514</ref> and <ref target="A516.TXT.1">A 516</ref>&#8212;of a poem-draft beginning, "We | talked with | each other | about each | other" ("We talked with | each other about | each other"), and both composed around 1879 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). Here the fragment-trace appears in the middle of the poem-draft, rather than at the poem-draft's opening or closing, as is more usual.  It may have been composed after the initial rough-copy draft (A 514) and before the second, intermediate-copy draft (A 516), since the second draft reflects at least one textual change introduced in the fragment. </p>

               <div type="Critical Commentary">
                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper appear to constitute separate textual spaces. A 637 carries an incomplete fair-copy draft of a letter to Susan Dickinson; A 637a carries a rough-copy fragment or pensÃ©e. Dickinson appears to have revised the rough-copy text as she wrote: three large cross, or "X," marks appear in the text of the document, possibly marking variant passages (for a tentative arrangement of variants, see the Variant View of the document). The texts on A 637 and A 637a both have links to other documents. In addition to being a draft of a message sent to Susan Dickinson <ref target="HCLB145.TXT.1">(HCL B 145)</ref> around 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), A 637 is linked to the fragment "Most Arrows" <ref target="A287.TXT.1">(A 287),</ref> which appears in this draft as a trace. Corresponding pinholes on A 637 and A 287 suggest that the documents were at one time physically associated. In the case of A 637a several lines of the fragment&#8212;"when I was a | little girl I called |  the Cemetery | Tarry Town | but now I | call it Trans -"&#8212;appear as a trace (text altered) in a letter to Catharine Dickinson Sweetser <ref target="ROSENBACH.TXT.1">(Rosenbach 1170 / 18 [26])</ref> composed around 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). In this instance the rough-copy fragment was almost certainly written before the letter to Sweetser, not as a draft of the letter but as an autonomous text, which Dickinson later mined for lines.</p>
                  <p>No link, save a material one, has ever been established between the texts inscribed on A 637 and A 637a: written in different hands, on different occasions, they appear to be discrete. Yet the Sweetser letter suggests that Dickinson drew on both texts during the course of composition, for the line in the letter directly following the trace to A 637a&#8212;"In this place of | shafts, I hope | you may remain | unharmed -"&#8212;may allude both to the text on A 637 and, by implication, to the fragment A 287: thus, the "Arrows" of A 287, reinscribed and pinned to A 637, may also be translated into the "shafts" that enter the fair-copy letter to Sweetser. The study of textual constellations reveals the constant migration and transmigration of meanings and intentions between and among texts.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. A 638 carries a (partial?) fair-copy draft of a letter to Ned Dickinson; A 638a carries a rough-copy fragment or pensÃ©e, the final, overflow lines of which are penciled in the left, right, and bottom margins of the fair-copy letter-draft on A 638. The lines are a paraphrase and revision of Luke 10:21: "In that now Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight." Dickinson's final intentions toward the rough-copy fragment remain unknown. It may have been destined for incorporation into another composition, or it may be a free-standing text. The fragment on A 638 is a kind of  "crossed text": here the lines "That they have Existed - none | can take away" and "That they still Exist is a trust so daring" are composed perpendicular to and over the rest of the text. Both layers of text are readable.</p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. A 752a carries the remains of an abandoned message-draft, addressee and date of composition unknown. The message, now almost entirely illegible, was probably saved only because Dickinson used the other side of the paper to jot down the text beginning "Emerging from | an Abyss and | entering it again -." The brief, extrageneric fragment inscribed on A 752, by itself an autonomous text, appears as a trace in a letter to Susan Dickinson <ref target="HCLB148.TXT.1">(HCL B 148)</ref> composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). A single, horizontal pencil line along the torn bottom edge of the manuscript, along with several stray letters and marks, indicate that text has been lost, though whether the lost text belonged to the extant fragment or to another text, possibly torn away in an act of revision designed to isolate the extant prose fragment, is not known. </p>

The message to Higginson registers Dickinson's shock at the news of Helen Hunt Jackson's death; the provenance of the note to Gillett, if indeed it was addressed to her, is not known.

                  <p>This fragment appears in part as a trace (text altered) in a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG106.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 106)</ref> composed in June 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). In this case the opening passage of the text&#8212;"If ever you lost | a friend - Master - | you remember you | could not begin | again because there | was no world -"&#8212;constitutes the trace, and, possibly, a trial beginning to the letter. The concluding passage of the text&#8212;"A breathless Death | is not so cold as | a Death that breathes"&#8212;does not reappear as a trace in this letter or in any other extant composition, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the passage are unknown. Less personal or "occasional" than the lines directly addressed to Higginson, the final lines of the text suggest a change of direction of or intention towards the fragment. Dickinson may have omitted the lines from the final draft of the letter to Higginson in order to preserve its consolatory tone. </p>

                  <p>A 809, by itself an extrageneric fragment or pensÃ©e, has links to three documents: it is an intermediate- or fair-copy draft and variant version of another late fragment composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>)<ref target="A802.TXT.1">(A 802);</ref> an early, variant draft of a message composed in late summer 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) and possibly sent to Sara Philips Colton Gillett <ref target="ORESMAN.TXT.1">(Oresman);</ref> and a trace (text altered) in a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG116.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 116)</ref> mailed in early August 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). Dickinson's handwriting is unusually large, ill-formed, and reckless, suggesting that she was ill at the time of the fragment's composition or that she was writing under unfavorable circumstances, in darkness, for instance, or under great stress. For other examples of distorted handwriting, see <ref target="FIG-A848">A 848</ref> and <ref target="FIG-A879">A 879.</ref>

                  <p>The relationship between the fragments composed on the opposite sides of the paper is ambiguous. The text inscribed on A 838 appears as a trace in a letter to Maria Whitney <ref target="WHITNEY.TXT.1">(Ms Am 1118.10 [6])</ref> composed in 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), soon after the death of Samuel Bowles. The text inscribed on A 838a, by itself an autonomous, extrageneric fragment, may have been destined for incorporation into a poem or a letter, perhaps the letter to Whitney; alternatively, it may be a private comment on Maria Whitney's grief, not included in the final draft of the letter in order to preserve the letter's consolatory tone. Several stray pencil marks along the top edge of A 838 indicate that text has been lost beyond the tear, though whether the lost text belonged to the extant fragment or to another composition is not known.</p>

                  <p>The fragment, by itself an autonomous text, appears, in part, as a trace (text altered) in a fair-copy draft of a letter <ref target="A847.TXT.1">(A 847)</ref> possibly composed in early 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) and found among Dickinson's papers at the time of her death; the provenance and addressee of the letter remain unknown. In this case the opening lines of the fragment&#8212;"Peter took the | Marine walk | at a great | risk -"&#8212;constitutes the trace; it is an allusion to Matthew 14:25&#8211;32: "And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  And he said, Come. And when Peter was down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased." The closing lines of the text&#8212;"I think | I am correct | but the | Apostles | misgive | me"&#8212;are not incorporated into this letter or into any other extant composition, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment as a whole remain unknown. Underscoring Dickinson's sympathy with Peter and her skepticism, the fragment's final lines may have been deliberately omitted from the letter in order to preserve its more orthodox tone. Dickinson's handwriting is unusually large and ill-formed, suggesting that she was ill at the time of the fragment's composition or that she was writing under unfavorable circumstances, in darkness, for instance, or from her bed.

                  <p>A 879, a freestanding extrageneric fragment or pensÃ©e, is also a rough- copy variant version of another fragment <ref target="A851.TXT.1">(A 851)</ref> composed in the last decade of Dickinson's life. In this case the closing passage of the fragment inscribed on A 879&#8212;"A something | over takes the | mind - we do | not hear it | coming"&#8212;appears, truncated, as the closing passage of the text inscribed on A 851&#8212;"A something | overtakes the | Mind -." The precise nature of the relationship between the two fragments, one a meditation on the disorienting experience of reading (the book of) nature, the other on the similarly disorienting experience of reading poetry, remains unknown. The text on A 879 may be an oblique allusion to a passage in R. W. Emerson's "The Poet": "As the traveller who has lost his way throws his reins on the horse's neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world." Neither A 879 nor A 851 was incorporated into another extant composition. Here Dickinson's handwriting is unusually large and ill- formed, suggesting that she was ill at the time of the fragment's composition or that she was writing under unfavorable circumstances, in darkness, for instance, or under great stress.

                  <p>This brief text, composed on a single leaf of stationery, appears to have turned back into a draft when Dickinson crossed out the misspelled word "annull" and wrote "discontinue -" in a rough-copy hand above it. The text inscribed on A 855 appears, in part, as a trace (text altered) in a fair-copy draft of a letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG106.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 106)</ref> composed in June 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). In this case the opening passage of the fragment&#8212;"God cannot | <del rend="strike-out" status="unremarkable">annull</del> (discontinue -) himself -"&#8212;constitutes the trace; the closing passage&#8212;"This appalling | trust is at times | all that | remains -"&#8212;is not incorporated into the letter to Higginson or into any other extant composition, and Dickinson's final intentions toward the fragment remain unknown. It may be an early draft of the passage in the letter to Higginson or an autonomous pensÃ©e. The unorthodox final lines of A 855 may have been deliberately omitted from the final draft of the letter in order to preserve its consolatory tone. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. A 820a carries the remains of an abandoned, and now partly illegible, message-draft. It may be the draft of a letter to George Montague, the fair-copy of which contains one or two similar phrases (see J L 703) to those in the fragment. The text inscribed on A 820, by itself a single, exquisite line of prose or verse, appears as a trace in three fair-copy drafts of Dickinson's final letter to Helen Hunt Jackson&#8212;<ref target="A817.TXT.1">A 817; </ref>

Dickinson's final intentions toward this fragment remain unknown. It may be an early draft of the passage in the letter to Hunt Jackson or an autonomous pensÃ©e composed independently of the letter and incorporated in it because of its momentary aptness. </p>

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper appear to constitute separate textual spaces. A 883a, inscribed "Little Margaret," appears to be a fair-copy address or salutation, possibly excerpted from a lost message. The identity of "Little Margaret" is uncertain. Abigail Girdler Cooper's granddaughter Margaret was born in 1884; a letter composed by Dickinson to Abigail Cooper in 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) carries a pinned slip <ref target="YUL.TXT.2">(YUL)</ref> inscribed "Little Margaret," and it is likely that this fragment also refers to her. There is, however, another possibility. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, too, had a daughter named Margaret, to whom Dickinson also wrote in 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>); her message (see <title>Letters</title> [1958], L 893 ) remembers Higginson's infant daughter Louisa, who died before Margaret's birth. The "Lethargies of Loneliness" may refer to Margaret's (or Higginson's) loss of Louisa or to another, private grief, the source of which is unrecoverable. The fragment inscribed on A 883 is too brief to be generically decidable: it may be a single lyric throe destined for incorporation into a poem, a passage destined for incorporation into a letter, or a cryptic but complete message. Though no link has ever been established between the texts on A 883 and A 883a, it is worth noting that Dickinson seems to have wished to preserve both fragments: the paper has been carefully torn, and both texts appear centered on the scrap. Because of the ambiguous nature of the text, A 883a appears in both the "Index of Trace Fragments" and in the "Index of Other Texts Inscribed on Documents Carrying Fragments."</p>

                  <p>The number of fragments inscribed on A 821 and the relations among them are ambiguous. Although the texts appearing on either side of the envelope seam were both composed in a rough-copy hand, slight variations in the writing style suggest that they were written on different occasions. The envelope seam, moreover, appears to function as a textual boundary. A smaller, pinned slip both completes the passage beginning "Afternoon and | the West and . . ." and carries the remains of an abandoned text, lost beyond the tear. In addition to the two sets of pinholes visible on the small pinned slip, four sets of pinholes&#8212;two on the left wing of the envelope and two on the right wing of the envelope&#8212;point to the document's material/textual instability and its potential for further transformations. One stray pencil mark appears along the left edge of the envelope; a similar vertical line appears on the pinned slip, dividing legible text from illegible text lost beyond the tear. </p>
                  <p>The passage on the left wing of the envelope, "Clogged | only with | Music, like | the Wheels of | Birds -," appears as a trace in four documents, all composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>): it appears as a variant trace (text altered) in another late (pinned) fragment <ref target="A822.TXT.1">(A 822);</ref> as a variant trace (text altered) in a letter to Benjamin Kimball <ref target="NYPL.TXT.1">(NYPL&#8212;Berg);</ref> as a nearly exact trace (punctuation and capitalization only altered) in a fair-copy draft of a letter to Helen Hunt Jackson <ref target="A817.TXT.1">(A 817);</ref> and as a variant trace (text altered) in another fair-copy version of the same letter-draft to Helen Hunt Jackson <ref target="A819.TXT.1">(A 819).</ref> The passage on the right wing of the envelope, "Afternoon and | the West and | the gorgeous | nothings | which | compose | the | sunset | keep [pinned slip] their high | Appoint | ment," is not incorporated into this letter or into any other extant composition, though it is, perhaps, translated into the late fragment <ref target="A822.TXT.2">(A 822a)</ref> cited previously, where the transition from day to night or night to day is raised exponentially to a transition of seasons: "and the Seasons | take their hushed | places like figures | in a Dream -." Dickinson's final intentions toward these fragments remain unknown. They may be drafts of passages in the letters to Benjamin Kimball or Hunt Jackson, or autonomous pensÃ©es composed independently of the letters and incorporated in them because of their momentary aptness.</p>

                  <p>The relationship between the texts inscribed on the pinned fragments is ambiguous. Although both of the texts were composed in a rough-copy hand, variations in the handwriting on the two scraps suggest that they were written on different occasions. Each scrap appears to carry a separate fragment that, unpinned, would turn back into an autonomous text. The sudden association, by pinning, of the two texts creates a new, albeit inherently unstable and extrageneric text, "A 822 / 822a." The "correct" reading order of the fragments is, like the compositional order, unknown. One passage inscribed on A 822, "Thronged | only with Music, like the | Decks of | Birds -," appears as a trace in four documents, all composed in or around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>): it appears as a variant trace (text altered) in another late pinned fragment <ref target="A821.TXT.1">(A 821);</ref> as a nearly exact trace in a letter to Benjamin Kimball <ref target="NYPL.TXT.1">(NYPL&#8212;Berg);</ref> as a variant trace (text altered) in a fair-copy draft of Dickinson's last letter to Helen Hunt Jackson <ref target="A817.TXT.1">(A 817);</ref> and, as a nearly exact trace (punctuation and capitalization only altered) in another fair-copy version of the same letter-draft to Hunt Jackson <ref target="A819.TXT.1">(A 819).</ref> The opening passage of A 822, "It is very still in the | world now -," does not reappear in any other extant composition. Likewise, the text carried on A 822a, "and the Seasons | take their hushed | places like figures | in a Dream -," is not incorporated into any other extant composition, though it is, perhaps, translated into a variant fragment&#8212;<ref target="A821.TXT.2">A 821</ref>&#8212;where the transition of the seasons is mirrored in the transition from day to night. Dickinson's final intentions toward these fragments remain unknown. They may be drafts of passages in the letters to Benjamin Kimball or Hunt Jackson, or autonomous pensÃ©es composed independently of the letters and incorporated in them because of their momentary aptness.</p>

                  <p>The text inscribed on A 865, by itself an extrageneric fragment, appears as a trace or echo (text altered) in a letter to Elizabeth Carmichael composed around 1880 (<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>This is one of a number of late manuscripts in which the opposite sides of the paper constitute separate textual spaces. A 309 carries a rough-copy poem-draft beginning "Of whom so dear | the name to hear" and composed around 1880 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). A 310 carries an autonomous fragment or lyric pensÃ©e, presumably composed after the poem-draft was abandoned. One line of the fragment&#8212;"persistent as perdition"&#8212;appears as a trace or echo in an earlier, rough-copy poem-draft beginning "Risk is the Hair | that holds the Tun" <ref target="A339.TXT.1">(A 339)</ref> and composed around 1872 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); the trace line in the poem reads, "Per - suasive as Perdition." In this instance it is possible that Dickinson remembered the line from the poem-draft of "Risk is the Hair" when composing A 310 and used a variant of it. Both the poem-draft inscribed on A 309 and the fragment inscribed on A 310 are written within the rule of the paper; the substitutions and variants, however, many of which remain unresolved, are added interlinearly. </p>
                  <p>One editorial notation&#8212;"yes"&#8212;is penciled on A 310 in Millicent Todd Bingham's hand; it appears beside the same word in Dickinson's hand, clarifying the faint and difficult to decipher text. </p>

                  <p>The inside of the seal carries a rough-copy draft of a message to Susan  Dickinson composed around 1882 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). The seal appears to act as a textual boundary, separating the message-fragment from the other, extrageneric fragments on the outside of the envelope: if the envelope were properly folded, the message-draft would disappear. The fragments inscribed on the outside of the envelope are so brief that, alone, they remain generically undecidable, sometimes appearing as exquisite lyric throes, sometimes only as random words and phrases. They reappear, however, as faint traces, in a rough- and a fair-copy draft of the poem beginning "Pompless | no Life | can pass | away -" ("No Life can | pompless pass | away -") and composed around 1882 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>); see <ref target="A332.TXT.1">A 332</ref> and <ref target="A333.TXT.1">A 333.</ref> Dickinson may have jotted down the fragments on the envelope while working on the rough-copy draft. Dickinson's handwriting on the manuscript is faint, in places illegible, possibly because of erasures. The envelope face is addressed by Judge Otis P. Lord, in brown ink, to "Misses Emily and Vinnie Dickinson | Amherst | Mass," and postmarked Salem <hi rend="small caps">P.M.</hi> Dec. 11.</p>

                  <p>Dickinson bound this fair-copy poem-draft into a manuscript volume around 1863 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) or 1864 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). For related fragments, see <ref target="A100.TXT.1">A 100</ref> (about 1863 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>], about 1864 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]) and <ref target="A313.TXT.1">A 313</ref> (about 1873 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1874 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). The early fragment may have catalyzed the composition of the first version of the poem, or it may be a reworking of the last lines of the first version's second stanza, composed shortly after Dickinson completed the first version of the text. Dickinson may have remembered&#8212;returned to?&#8212;the fragment approximately ten years later when she began composing a second version of the poem. The later fragment is a variant of the earlier fragment as well, of course, as a variant of the lines in H 159. Although neither fragment appears as a trace in the latter version of the poem (H 322), both may have in some sense catalyzed the compositional process. </p>
                  <p>Three editorial notations are penciled on H 159: upper left, David Peck Todd: <hi rend="italics">30</hi> (blue pencil); upper left: <hi rend="italics">9;</hi> upper left: <hi rend="italics">ch.</hi> In his introduction to <title><ref target="abbr.poem1955" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1955) Thomas H. Johnson offers the following description of David Todd's numbering of manuscript volumes: "With a blue pencil Professor Todd placed a number at the top of the first page of each packet and, as they later came into his house, on the envelopes containing the remaining manuscripts. His sequence goes 1 through 40, 80 through 110." In <title>The Editing of Emily Dickinson</title> (1967) R. W. Franklin suggests that the numbering may instead have been done by Todd's wife: "The numbering of the packets, mostly in blue pencil, appears to me to have been largely done by Mrs. Todd. Millicent Todd Bingham, who is thoroughly familiar with her mother's handwriting, agrees" (149 n. 23). In <title>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</title> (1981), however, Franklin appears in this case to agree with Johnson and identifies the mark as David Todd's. The authorship and significance of the other editorial notations on H 159 have not been established.</p>

                  <p>Dickinson sent this letter (with enclosures) to Thomas Niles around 1883 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). For a variant fair-copy of the poem beginning "Her Losses make | our Gains ashamed -" and sent to Susan Dickinson, see <ref target="H266.TXT.1">H 266</ref> (spring 1883 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>, Smith and Hart]); for a related fragment, see <ref target="A207.TXT.1">A 207</ref> (about 1883 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]).</p>
                  <p>Mabel Loomis Todd (?) penciled transcripts of the enclosed poems directly onto Dickinson's manuscript; they appear on the versos of the first, fourth, seventh, and ninth leaves with titles based on Dickinson's characterizations in the letter: "Marian Evans"; "A Thunder Storm"; "The Humming Bird"; and "A Country Burial." There are many differences in lineation between the manuscript and the transcripts as well as several differences between the wording of the titles on the transcripts and the wording of the titles penciled above the enclosed poems. Todd did not transcribe the embedded poem on the manuscript.</p>
                  <p>Two editorial notations are penciled on A 833: upper right, <abbr expan="Mabel Loomis Todd">MLT</abbr>: <hi rend="italics, underlined">Mr Niles;</hi> upper right, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr> (?): <hi rend="italics">417.</hi> The first notation presumably identifies the source of the manuscript as Thomas Niles; the second notation, perhaps also made by Mabel Loomis Todd, but more likely made by Bingham, indicates that the text&#8212;or a version of it&#8212;was previously published in <title>Letters</title> (1894), 417&#8211;18.</p>

                  <p>This poem-letter was sent to Susan Dickinson around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). For a related fragment, see <ref target="A249.TXT.1">A 249 / 250</ref> (about 1883 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1883 or last decade [<abbr expan="Thomas H.

The fragment appears on a scrap of stationery with several others, all of which appear to have been jotted down by Dickinson at the same time, perhaps in an effort to create a more permanent record of random lines. It is likely that she drew on this record when composing the poem. An echo of the opening lines of this text may be heard in a draft of Dickinson's last letter to Helen Hunt Jackson composed in March 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>): "Immured the whole | of Life | Within a magic | Prison | We reprimand the | Happiness | That too com- | petes with Heaven - " <ref target="A819.TXT.1">(A 819).</ref>

The allusion to <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> (II.ii.225&#8211;26) appears, altered, in both a letter to Edward (Ned) Dickinson, <ref target="HCLB118.TXT.1">HCL B 118,</ref> composed in late 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), and in a fragment, <ref target="A249.TXT.3">A 249 / 250,</ref> possibly composed in 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). At some point, perhaps during the editing of <title>Face to Face</title> (1932), the signature on the letter to Ned Dickinson was torn away and physically associated with this letter to Susan Dickinson. Small amounts of what appears to be glue or paste residue on HCL B 24 may indicate that this letter was pasted into a letter album. The verso of the manuscript (not reproduced here) is addressed, by Dickinson, "Susan -." </p>

                  <p>The final sentence of this letter mailed to Ned Dickinson in late 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>) has been torn away; it was associated at some point with a letter to Susan Dickinson <ref target="HCLB24.TXT.1">(HCL B 24)</ref> composed in the early 1880s (Smith and Hart), possibly 1883 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). The damage may have occurred during the editing of <title>Face to Face</title> (1932), since that edition reflects this change. Three, possibly four, sets of pin pricks are clustered around Dickinson's signature on this document, suggesting that the lost sentence may have been reattached sometime later, though by whom is not clear. For a related fragment, see <ref target="A249.TXT.3">A 249 / 250</ref>  (about 1883 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1883 or last decade [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). The fragment is inscribed on a scrap of stationery with several others, all of which appear to have been jotted down by Dickinson at the same time, perhaps in an effort to create a more permanent record of random lines. She may have drawn on this record, or on the letter to Susan Dickinson (HCL B 24), when composing the letter to Ned.</p>

               <div type="Critical Commentary">
                  <p>This fair-copy poem was enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 73; J L 513) sent to Thomas Wentworth Higginson in 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). In the header, in pencil, Thomas Wentworth Higginson identified the poem as "The Blue Bird," based on Dickinson's characterization in the letter. Pinholes appear in upper left corner of manuscript, suggesting that other documents&#8212;perhaps the other poems enclosed with the letter&#8212;were attached to this poem or, alternatively, that the poems were attached to the letter, either by Dickinson or, more likely, by Higginson. The left edge of the manuscript has been folded over and pasted down; small amounts of glue or paste residue on the manuscript suggest that it may have been kept in an album. Three other poems were enclosed with this letter: "It sounded | as if the | streets were | running"; "She laid her | docile Crescent | down"; and "I have no | Life but this -." For an earlier fair-copy draft of the poem beginning "After all | Birds have | been investigated," see <ref target="A94-1.TXT.1">A 94-1 / 2</ref> (about 1875 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]; about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]); for a rough-copy draft of the second stanza beginning "First at the | March," see <ref target="A127.TXT.1">A 127</ref> (about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]); for a fair-copy draft of the last lines of the poem beginning "Last to | adhere | When Summers | swerve away -," see <ref target="A298.TXT.1">A 298</ref> (about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]); and, for an identical fair-copy of the poem's final lines beginning "Last to | adhere | When Summers | swerve away -" and sent to Samuel Bowles, see <ref target="A711.TXT.1">A 711</ref> (about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]). For a related fragment, see <ref target="A255.TXT.1">A 255</ref> (about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]). In <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), R. W. Franklin suggests that A 255 was composed after A 298 and A 711, but before BPL Higg 35, since the fair-copy to Higginson reflects some of the changes introduced in the previous drafts. The definitive compositional history of the textual constellation, however, remains open to speculation.</p>

                  <p>This poem was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Though it was composed around 1875 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), long after she had ceased binding her work into manuscript volumes, the poem has been carefully copied and may constitute evidence that Dickinson continued, at least on occasion, to prepare manuscripts for binding in the 1870s.  For a rough-copy draft of the second stanza beginning "First at the | March," see <ref target="A127.TXT.1">A 127</ref> (about 1877 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W.

                  <p>This letter was mailed to Susan Dickinson around 1883 (Smith and Hart) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). The pencil line beside the final lines of the embedded poem may have been drawn by Susan Dickinson to mark a passage that had special significance for her. Paste marks on the manuscript suggest that it may have been pasted into an album. For an earlier, incomplete fair-copy draft of the letter, see <ref target="A637.TXT.1">A 637</ref> (October 1884 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>], about 1884 [<abbr expan="Ralph W.

                  <p>This fair-copy poem was enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 83; J L 449) sent to T. W. Higginson around 1876 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). Dickinson enclosed four other poems with the letter: "The Heart | is the | Capital of | the Mind"; "The Mind | lives on the | Heart"; "The Rat | is the | concisest | Tenant"; and "'Faithful to | the end' | amended."  For an initial rough-copy draft of "The last | of Summer," see <ref target="A404.TXT.1">A 404</ref> (about 1875 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1876 [<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>This fair-copy poem-draft, composed around 1875 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1876 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Though it was composed long after Dickinson had ceased binding her work into manuscript volumes, it has been carefully copied and may constitute evidence that she continued, at least on occasion, to prepare manuscripts for binding in the 1870s. One stab hole along the left-hand edge of the document perhaps indicates that Dickinson intended to bind the sheet into a manuscript volume but later abandoned the idea. For an initial rough-copy draft of the poem, see <ref target="A404.TXT.1">A 404</ref> (about 1875 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1876 [<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>Three editorial notations are penciled on the recto of H 380: at top, center, Mary Lee Hall: <hi rend="italics">0;</hi> at top, center, <abbr expan="Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson">SHGD</abbr>?: <hi rend="italics">+;</hi> upper right, <abbr expan="Martha Dickinson Bianchi">MDB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics">No.</hi> After Mabel Loomis Todd stopped working on Dickinson's manuscripts, Lavinia Dickinson employed Mary Lee Hall to copy poems. Hall's notation identifies poems not published in the first three series of <title>Poems</title> (1890, 1891, 1896). Similarly, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, who inherited her mother's stock of Dickinson manuscripts, marked those not published <hi rend="italics">No.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">+</hi> may indicate Susan Dickinson's or, possibly, Lavinia Dickinson's ranking of the poem.</p>

                  <p>Two editorial notations are penciled on the document: A 404, upper right, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics"><ref target="abbr.FP1929" rend="bibl">FP</ref>;</hi> A 404a, below the concluding lines of the poem, upside-down, <abbr expan="Mabel Loomis Todd">MLT</abbr>?: <hi rend="italics">98 (4).</hi> The first notation indicates that the text&#8212;or a version of it&#8212;was published in <title>Further Poems</title> (1929), 85. The second notation may refer to the number of the envelope, and subdivision within the envelope, in which Mabel Loomis Todd stored this unbound manuscript. In her <hi rend="small caps">"GUIDE</hi> to the use of the microfilm of <hi rend="small caps">THE EMILY DICKINSON MANUSCRIPTS"</hi> Millicent Todd Bingham notes that Mabel Loomis Todd affixed the numbers 80&#8211;98 to the envelopes containing fascicles or individual poems, while Bingham herself affixed all numbers greater than 98 to the remainder of the envelopes. Presumably Todd, or possibly Bingham, also penciled the notation "98 (4)" on the manuscript itself.</p>

                  <p>This fair-copy trial beginning for the poem "The last of | Summer is" was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Though it was composed in 1875 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1876 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>),  long after she had ceased binding her work into manuscript volumes, the trial beginning has been carefully copied and may constitute evidence that Dickinson continued, at least on occasion, to prepare manuscripts for binding in the 1870s. Mabel Loomis Todd completed the last line of the trial beginning, adding, in pencil, the words "in retrospect." For an initial rough-copy draft of the poem, see <ref target="A404.TXT.1">A 404</ref> (about 1875 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1876 [<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>This fair-copy poem-draft was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Though it was composed in 1871 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), some years after she had ceased binding her work into manuscript volumes, the poem has been carefully copied and may constitute evidence that Dickinson continued, at least on occasion, to prepare manuscripts for binding in the 1870s. For another fair-copy version of this poem sent to Susan Dickinson, see <ref target="H307.TXT.1">H 307</ref> (1870s [Smith and Hart]; about 1873 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]; about 1874 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]); for a related fragment, see <ref target="A314.TXT.1">A 313 / 314.</ref> In <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), R. W. Franklin hypothesizes that the fragment may have been composed between the first and second versions of the poem, since the second fair-copy (H 307) to Sue reflects the change of wording offered in the fragment. The definitive compositional history of the textual constellation, however, remains open to speculation. </p>

                  <p>This rough-copy poem-draft, composed around 1872 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. For a later echo of the lines "Per-suasive | as Perdition," see Dickinson's fragment <ref target="A310.TXT.1">A 309 / 310</ref> (about 1880 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1880 or last decade [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). The outside of the slit envelope is addressed by Lavinia Dickinson, in black ink, "Dr. E. M. Pease | Springfield | Mass -." </p>
                  <p>One editorial notation is penciled on A 339a: right of address, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics">107.</hi> The first notation may refer to the number of the envelope in which Mabel Loomis Todd stored this unbound manuscript. In her <hi rend="small caps">"GUIDE</hi> to the use of the microfilm of <hi rend="small caps">THE EMILY DICKINSON MANUSCRIPTS"</hi> Millicent Todd Bingham notes that Mabel Loomis Todd affixed the numbers 80&#8211;98 to the envelopes containing fascicles or individual poems, while Bingham herself affixed all numbers greater than 98 to the remainder of the envelopes. Presumably, Bingham also penciled the notation "107" on the manuscript itself. </p>

                  <p>This letter was sent to Susan Dickinson in autumn 1873 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>, Smith and Hart). For a related fragment, see <ref target="A348.TXT.1">A 348</ref> (about 1873 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]). This fair-copy fragment, possibly a compressed poem, appears to have been composed before the letter in which it is embedded. Yet it is also possible that the letter was composed first, and the lines later excerpted. The faultline between prose and verse in the letter is not entirely clear&#8212;does prose become verse in the line "Silence is all | we dread," as suggested in the present encoding, or does prose become verse at an earlier or later point?&#8212;and further ambiguates the temporal relationship between the fragment and the letter. </p>

                  <p>This fair-copy poem-draft was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Though it was composed around 1871 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), several years after she had ceased binding her work into manuscript volumes, the poem has been carefully copied and may constitute evidence that Dickinson continued, at least on occasion, to prepare manuscripts for binding in the 1870s. For a fair-copy of the poem sent to Thomas Wentworth Higginson, see <ref target="BPLHIGG26.TXT.1">BPL Higg 26</ref> (about 1871 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]); for a related fragment, see <ref target="A352.TXT.1">A 351 / 352</ref> (about 1871 [<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>], about 1871 or last decade [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). A variant version of the first stanza, not containing the trace-fragment, was sent to Susan Dickinson (H 322). The fragment may have catalyzed the composition of the poem; alternatively, it may have broken free from the poem sometime after its composition. It carries a variant reading not incorporated into any of the three versions of the poem. The definitive compositional history of the textual constellation remains open to speculation.</p>

                  <p>This fair-copy poem was enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 74; J L 368) sent to T. W. Higginson around 1871 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W.

For a fair-copy draft of "Step lightly on this narrow spot" found among Dickinson's papers after her death, see <ref target="A95-12.TXT.1">A 95-12</ref>  (about 1871 [<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>This rough-copy poem-draft, composed around 1873 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. Several sets of pin pricks (three sets on fragment 1, two sets on fragment 2) are visible on the manuscript, indicating that the two scraps have been pinned and unpinned more than once. The poem reappears, altered, in a (destroyed) fair-copy letter sent by Dickinson to Fanny and Louise Norcross also around 1873 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); see <ref target="TRA43A.TXT.1">Tr A 43a.</ref> One additional manuscript of the poem, carrying only the lines of the second stanza, is extant, though its present location is unknown; a photostat of the stanza is held by the Jones Library, Inc.  For a related fragment, a trial beginning for A 462, see <ref target="A463.TXT.1">A 463</ref> (about 1873 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W.

                  <p>One editorial notation appears on A 462: top right: <hi rend="italics">?.</hi> The significance of the ? is not known. </p>

                  <p>The original holograph of this text was destroyed by Frances and/or Louise Norcross. This text reproduces the transcript of the poem made by Frances (Fanny) Norcross for Mabel Loomis Todd. For a rough-copy draft of this poem, see <ref target="A462.TXT.1">A 462</ref> (about 1873 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]); for a related fragment, see <ref target="A463.TXT.1">A 463</ref> (about 1873 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>]).</p>
                  <p>The transcript of this poem appears in <title>Letters</title> (1894), incorporated in a letter to the Norcrosses. In <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), however, R. W. Franklin notes that the poem and the letter to the Norcrosses were probably discrete documents, combined by Todd during her editing of <title>Letters</title> (1894). The editorial notations penciled on the document are Mabel Loomis Todd's. </p>

                  <p>This poem-letter, possibly composed and sent to Mabel Loomis Todd around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), carries the final lines of "We like March." It may be a compressed version of that poem, or it may be that this leaf has been detached from the first leaf of the manuscript carrying the first part of the poem. Todd's note in the header of the manuscript&#8212;"(Thinking you may like to see a bit of E. D.'s original writing)"&#8212;indicates that she offered the leaf as a souvenir, possibly to Denis Wortman; if so, she may have disseminated other leaves from the manuscript.

                  <p>Dickinson sent this fair-copy poem, composed around 1871 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1872 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), to Susan Dickinson. Several years later, possibly in 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), she returned to revise the poem. A fragment, <ref target="A509.TXT.1">A 509 / 510,</ref> inscribed with a variant of the poem's last lines, may have been her point of departure for the later version.  For an intermediate-copy draft of the 1878 version of the poem, see <ref target="A508.TXT.1">A 508;</ref> for a fair-copy draft of the 1878 version of the poem, possibly intended for Elizabeth Holland, but found among Dickinson's papers after her death, see <ref target="A511.TXT.1">A 511;</ref> for another fair-copy draft of the poem also composed around this time and found among Dickinson's papers after her death, see <ref target="PRINCETON.TXT.1">Princeton;</ref> for a fair-copy of the final stanza composed around 1883 (<abbr expan="Ralph W.

                  <p>This rough-copy poem-draft, composed in the 1870s (Smith and Hart), possibly around 1877 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>), found its way into Susan Dickinson's papers at some point after Dickinson's death. For different versions of the provenance of this manuscript, see R. W. Franklin's introduction to <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson.</title> Variorum edition. 3 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard University P, 1998) and Smith's and Hart's <title>Open Me Carefully: Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington Dickinson</title> (Ashfield, Mass.: Paris Press, 1998). The haphazard disposition of this rough-copy poem-draft across the paper makes the interpretation and representation of variant readings problematic; viewers are urged to consult the facsimile and the diplomatic transcription of the manuscript. For a related fragment, see <ref target="A510.TXT.1">A 509 / 510.</ref> In <title><ref target="abbr.poem1998" rend="bibl">Poems</ref></title> (1998), R. W. Franklin indicates that the fragment carrying the lines "Yearns no more | for that Peninsula" was composed shortly before H 338, perhaps catalyzing the compositional process, but it may been composed after the rough-copy draft. Dickinson inscribed the fragment on quadrille stationery, and in a hand that exhibits at least some of the characteristics of her fair-copy hand.</p>
                  <p>One heavily overwritten and illegible notation is penciled on H 338 (upper left); the authorship and significance of the notation are not known.</p>

                  <p>This rough-copy poem-draft, composed around 1879 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) on the back of an envelope, was found among Dickinson's papers after her death. The envelope has been addressed, in brown ink, by Elizabeth Holland (?) to: Miss Emily Dickinson, | Amherst, | Mass.; it is postmarked Philadelphia, 24 Nov. (1876?). For a later, variant intermediate-copy draft of the poem, see <ref target="A516.TXT.1">A 516;</ref> for a related fragment, see <ref target="A515.TXT.1">A 515.</ref>  The fragment may have been composed after the initial rough-copy draft and before the second, intermediate-copy draft, since the second version reflects at least one textual change introduced in the fragment. </p>
                  <p>One editorial notation is penciled on A 514: beside the last line, <abbr expan="Millicent Todd Bingham">MTB</abbr>: <hi rend="italics">102.</hi> The notation may refer to the number of the envelope in which Mabel Loomis Todd stored this unbound manuscript. In her <hi rend="small caps">"GUIDE</hi> to the use of the microfilm of <hi rend="small caps">THE EMILY DICKINSON MANUSCRIPTS"</hi> Millicent Todd Bingham notes that Mabel Loomis Todd affixed the numbers 80&#8211;98 to the envelopes containing fascicles or individual poems, while Bingham herself affixed all numbers greater than 98 to the remainder of the envelopes. Presumably, Bingham also penciled the notation "102" on the manuscript itself.</p>

                  <p>This rough-copy poem-draft, composed around 1882 (<abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>) or 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H.

For a variant fair-copy draft of the poem, see <ref target="A333.TXT.1">A 333</ref>; for related fragments, see <ref target="A636.TXT.2">A 636a</ref>. Dickinson may have jotted down the fragments on the envelope while working on the rough-copy draft of the poem.</p>
                  <p>One editorial notation is penciled on A 332: reverse, below the last line of the text, <abbr expan="Mabel Loomis Todd">MLT</abbr>?: <hi rend="italics">98 (3).</hi> The notation may refer to the number of the envelope, and subdivision within the envelope, in which Mabel Loomis Todd stored this unbound manuscript. In her <hi rend="small caps">"GUIDE</hi> to the use of the microfilm of <hi rend="small caps">THE EMILY DICKINSON MANUSCRIPTS"</hi> Millicent Todd Bingham notes that Mabel Loomis Todd affixed the numbers 80&#8211;98 to the envelopes containing fascicles or individual poems, while Bingham herself affixed all numbers greater than 98 to the remainder of the envelopes. Presumably, Todd, or possibly Bingham, also penciled the notation "98 (3)" on the manuscript itself. </p>

                  <p>This letter was mailed to Susan Dickinson in late 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, Smith and Hart). Paste marks on the manuscript suggest that it was pasted into an album. For a related fragment, see <ref target="A752.TXT.2">A 752</ref>. The fragment may be a draft of a passage in the letter, or an autonomous text, incorporated into the letter because of its momentary aptness. </p>

                  <p>The provenance of this letter, composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), is unclear. In <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), Thomas H. Johnson notes: "Sara Colton was a friend of Martha Dickinson Bianchi. . . . [She] did not know and never saw ED. . . . The tone of this [letter], the signature, the concern with rhetorical effect, make one seriously doubt that it was in fact sent to Sara Colton. Nor was it sent to Susan Dickinson, for ED never signed notes to Sue thus. Whoever received it perhaps presented it to Sara Colton as a memento" (L 1011 n). The manuscript was later affixed to the front pastedown of a copy of the second volume of <title>Letters of Emily Dickinson</title> (1894). A small return address label reading "From | Mrs. Arthur L. Gillett | 16 North Marshall St. | Hartford, Conn." appears in the top left corner of the first leaf.  For additional information on Sara Philips Colton Gillett, see Thomas H. Johnson, <title><ref target="abbr.let1958" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1958), Appendix 1.</p>
                  <p>This text of this letter is incorporated, altered, into a much longer letter sent to T. W. Higginson in August 1885; see <ref target="BPLHIGG116">BPL Higg 116.</ref> Although the compositional order of the two letters is not clear, it seems likely that Dickinson drew on the letter to Gillett (?), as well as on two fragments (see below), when writing to Higginson. For related fragments, see  <ref target="A802.TXT.1">A 802</ref> and <ref target="A809.TXT.1">A 809</ref>. A 809, by itself an autonomous, extrageneric fragment, is also a variant rough-copy draft of A 802. Both A 809 and A 802 may be drafts of the letter to Gillett (?), or, independent texts, metamorphosed into a letter when the occasion called for it.</p>

                  <p>This letter was sent to Thomas Wentworth Higginson in June 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>). Two passages in this letter appear, text unaltered, in a letter from Dickinson to Maria Whitney, probably composed in early 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>); see <ref target="WHITNEY.TXT.1">Ms Am 1118 10 [6]</ref>. Like the letter to Whitney, sent to her soon after the death of Samuel Bowles, the letter to Higginson was sent shortly after the death of his wife. Dickinson may have remembered (or kept a record of) certain passages from the letter to Whitney when writing to Higginson. For related fragments, see <ref target="A808.TXT.1">A 808</ref> and <ref target="A855.TXT.1">A 855.</ref> Although both fragments may have been composed around 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), only one, inscribed on A 808, appears to be a draft of a passage in the letter; the other fragment, inscribed on A 855, was almost certainly an autonomous text, incorporated on this occasion because of its momentary aptness.  </p>
                  <p>One editorial notation is penciled on BPL Higg 106: upper left, <abbr expan="Mabel Loomis Todd">MLT</abbr>?: <hi rend="italics">[1878] [Summer].</hi> The notation presumably refers to the date Higginson received&#8212;or recalled receiving&#8212;the letter.</p>

                  <p>This letter was sent to Thomas Wentworth Higginson in August 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). Although the letter is in pencil, the accompanying envelope is addressed, in ink, by Dickinson: "Col. T. W. Higginson - | Cambridge - | Mass -." One passage in this letter appears, altered, in a letter possibly sent to Sara Philips Colton (Gillett) in late summer 1885; see <ref target="ORESMAN.TXT.1">Oresman.</ref> For related drafts and/or fragments, see <ref target="A802.TXT.1">A 802</ref> and <ref target="A809.TXT.1">A 809.</ref> These fragments, probably composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H.

                  <p>This fair-copy letter-draft, composed around 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W.

For additional drafts of this letter, see <ref target="A818.TXT.1">A 818</ref> and <ref target="A819.TXT.1">A 819</ref>; for related fragments, see <ref target="A820.TXT.2">A 820</ref>,

These fragments, probably composed around 1885, may be drafts for passages in Dickinson's last letter to Hunt Jackson, or, as seems more likely, autonomous texts, incorporated into this letter-draft because of their momentary aptness. One passage in this draft appears, altered, in an earlier (?) letter to Benjamin Kimball; see <ref target="NYPL.TXT.1">NYPL&#8212;Berg</ref> (1885 [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). The published versions of the letter-draft to Hunt Jackson are all composites based on manuscripts A 817, A 818, and A 819.</p>

                  <p>This letter was sent to Benjamin Kimball in 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). The poem "Though the | great Waters | sleep, | That they are | still the Deep, | We cannot | doubt. | No vacillating | God | Ignited this | Abode | To put it out," also composed on stationery embossed Pure Irish Linen F. H. D. &amp; Co. and impressed with a crown, may have been enclosed with it, or with another of Dickinson's letters to Benjamin Kimball; both letters and the poem, along with an envelope addressed by Dickinson, in brown ink, to "Benjamin Kimball. | 8 Congress St - | Boston - | Mass -" are filed together in the New York Public Library (Berg Collection). One passage in this letter reappears, altered, in two drafts of Dickinson's last letter to Helen Hunt Jackson, both composed around March 1885 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, <abbr expan="Ralph W. Franklin">RWF</abbr>); see <ref target="A817.TXT.1">A 817</ref> and <ref target="A819.TXT.1">A 819</ref>. For related fragments, see also <ref target="A821.TXT.1">A 821</ref> and <ref target="A822.TXT.1">A 822</ref>. These fragments may be drafts for passages in the letter, or, as seems more likely, autonomous texts, incorporated into this letter because of their momentary aptness. </p>

                  <p>This letter was sent to Maria Whitney in 1878 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>, Hart), soon after the death of Samuel Bowles. Two passages in the letter reappear, text unaltered, in a (later?) letter from Dickinson to Thomas Wentworth Higginson <ref target="BPLHIGG106.TXT.1">(BPL Higg 106)</ref>, possibly composed in June 1878 after the death of his wife. Dickinson may have remembered (or kept a record of) certain passages from the letter to Whitney when writing to Higginson.

                  <p>This letter was sent to Abigail Cooper around 1884 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>), presumably with the pinned slip. One set of pinholes (top center) is visible on the folded sheet carrying the letter; two sets of pinholes (top center; bottom right) appear on the scrap carrying the address, suggesting that Dickinson may have at one time pinned the slip to another document, or that Abigail Cooper herself unpinned and repinned it.

                  <p>Dickinson sent this letter to Thomas Wentworth Higginson in September 1877 (<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>). Small amounts of glue residue on the manuscript suggest that he may have pasted it into an album. Someone&#8212;perhaps Mabel Loomis Todd or Higginson himself&#8212;drew a large, light "X" through part of the text on the third leaf and then drew a zigzag line through all of the text on the fourth leaf. This letter was first published in part in <title><ref target="abbr.let1894" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1894); the light cancellation marks seem to indicate the text to be omitted from the printed edition. For a related fragment, see <ref target="A856.TXT.1">A 856</ref> (about 1877 or last decade [<abbr expan="Thomas H. Johnson">THJ</abbr>]). The fragment appears to be a trial draft for a passage  in the letter.</p>
                  <p>Two editorial notations are penciled on BPL Higg 86: leaf 1, recto, at top, center: <abbr expan="Thomas Wentworth Higginson">TWH</abbr>? <hi rend="italics">[1877];</hi> leaf 3, recto, right of line 6: <hi rend="italics">xxx.</hi> The first notation presumably refers to the date T. W. Higginson received&#8212;or recalled receiving&#8212;the letter. The authorship and significance of the second notation are unclear, though again the cross marks appear to indicate the beginning of the section of the text to be omitted from the printed version of the text in <title><ref target="abbr.let1894" rend="bibl">Letters</ref></title> (1894).</p>

         <p>The following fragments, identified by document catalog number and by first line(s), are considered "trace" fragments. These are fragments that appear&#8212;in part or in their entirety and often altered&#8212;in other poems, letters, or fragments in Dickinson's oeuvre. A single document may carry several different kinds of texts, including poems, messages, and autonomous fragments; here entries point specifically to the trace fragment(s) on a given document, rather than to the document as a whole. Selection of an entry from this index accesses the "Reading View" of the document. Tags in the "SGML View" identify lines, words, or phrases in the fragments that are traced to other documents.

Index of Document Constellations
         </head>
         <p>The document constellations below take as their points of departure Dickinson's trace and variant fragments among the primary texts featured in this archive, and show the texts to which they are related. Document constellations exhibit a marked centrifugal tendency that has not been fully represented here; that is, the more closely one considers the relations among documents, the more relations one discovers. Here, while the relations between Dickinson's fragments and the "target" documents in which they reappear in part or entire as traces are specified, the relations between the "target" documents in the constellations and other documents in Dickinson's oeuvre have not been specified unless they are also directly related to the fragments. In the future the document constellations given here may be extended to represent the complex relations among all of the documents&#8212;fragments <hi rend="italics">and</hi> "target" texts&#8212;in a given constellation and between these documents and all of the documents that make up Dickinson's oeuvre.

            <p>The following rough- and fair-copy drafts of messages were inscribed by Dickinson on documents also carrying fragments. Like the "Control Texts"&#8212;the vast majority of these "Other Texts" belong to the constellation of "Control Texts"&#8212;they share some of the characteristics of the fragments. Some of the texts included here are complete or nearly complete drafts of messages for which there are fair copies among Dickinson's papers (A 636; A 637). The other texts included here are rough- or fair-copy messages to specific, if not always clearly identified, addressees (A 638; A 864; A 887); these texts appear to be of a primarily "occasional" nature.</p>

Index of Control Documents and/or Texts
         </head>
         <p>The following documents and/or texts, drawn from Dickinson's late papers, but excluded from the archive proper, have been included to help clarify the criteria used to determine whether or not a given text belongs in the present configuration of "late fragments." The collation of the significant printed sources of the fragments reveals a lack of critical consensus regarding what constitutes a fragment in Dickinson's oeuvre, as well as a lack of consensus about how best to represent these textual and bibliographical escapes.<note n="51">The significant printed sources of Dickinson's fragments are: Millicent Todd Bingham and Mabel Loomis Todd, eds., <title>Bolts of Melody</title> (New York: Harper, 1945); Millicent Todd Bingham, <title>Emily Dickinson: A Revelation</title> (New York: Harper, 1954); Millicent Todd Bingham, ed., "Prose Fragments of Emily Dickinson." <title>New England Quarterly</title> 28 (September 1955): 291&#8211;318; Thomas H. Johnson, ed., <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson, Including variant readings critically compared with all known manuscripts.</title> 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1955; Thomas H. Johnson and Theodora Ward, eds., <title>The Letters of Emily Dickinson.</title> 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1958; and R. W. Franklin, ed., <title>The Poems of Emily Dickinson.</title>  Variorum edition. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1998.</note> The "Control Documents and/or Texts" gathered here, many of which appear in Bingham's or Johnson's collections of Dickinson's fragments, may also encourage speculation about alternative criteria that have been or can be used to define and represent "fragments." Most importantly, these documents and/or texts are included to foreground the difficulty, perhaps impossibility, of definitively demarcating the boundaries between Dickinson's late fragments and the mass of late, unbound, and bibliographically or generically ambiguous compositions found among her papers after her death.</p>
         <p>The texts below fall into five categories: rough-copy messages or message-fragments to specific, though not necessarily identified addressees; fair-copy (complete and incomplete) messages to identified and unidentified addressees; fragments "created" as a result of the dissociation of documents; fragments composed before 1870; and transcripts of poems or passages composed by other writers. There is some slippage. Some of the texts listed below (see, for example, A 97a; A 226; A 738; A 739; A 747; A 790; A 860; A 881) may well belong in the body of the archive, just as a number of texts included in the body of the archive (see, for example, A 175; A 249; A 359; A 361, A 808; A 856; A 883) may belong in the file of "Control Texts."<note n="52">The completion of a hypermedia archive of Dickinson's complete writings&#8212;work on which is now underway&#8212;will result in the revision of the present configuration of texts and documents, while revealing, in still more startling and complicated ways, Dickinson's resistance to bibliographical determination.</note> Selection of an entry from this index accesses the "Facsimile View" of the document. For further discussion of the criteria used to determine inclusion, see <title><ref target="IRS003">"The Interpretation of Radical Scatters."</ref>
